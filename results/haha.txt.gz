Given the many nasty things Amazon has done, and still does, it is not
a good thing to encourage people to do business with Amazon.
Paper books from Amazon are no different from paper books
bought elsewhere, but it is dangerous for Amazon (or anyone)
to have records of what books you bought.

In the future could you choose a different kind of incentive?

      Given the amount of 
    signups we have received for this data collection project, it is clear 
    that the Amazon incentive is popular.

That may be so, but it doesn't address the question of whether
distributing Amazon promotions is ethical conduct.

					   People may choose not to 
    participate just as they choose not to frequent/purchase from vendors 
    like Walmart or Microsoft or choose to change the channel on their TV...

You are not forcing people to buy from Amazon, but you are encouraging
it.  You're using your influence in support of Amazon's unethical
business.

When dealing with a large-scale organized abuse, individual
nonparticipation is a very weak response.  We need to organize to push
back, such as by telling Amazon, "No we don't want to promote you."

    In the end, it's your choice. Go with amazon or don't go with amazon.

We haved other options besides those two.  For instance, we can choose
to campaign against Amazon, as I am doing.

Declining to use a service is the fitting response if we find it to be
unsatisfactory.  When we find a service to be antisocial, merely
declining to use it is a weak and inadequate response.  To change
things, we need to go beyond that.  We need to organize.

									  It's
    not worth complaining about.

You might say that, if you don't care about any of the issues that are
at stake.  For instance, if you don't care about the survival of small
presses.  If you don't care about massive data collection about
individuals.  If you don't care about digital handcuffs.  If you don't
care about censorship.  If you don't care about aggression with
software patents.  (But if you're in software and you don't care about
the danger of software patents, you are walking in a daze.)

For those of us who care about some of these issues, it is well worth
complaining.  It is worth doing more than just complaining.  That's
why I am taking action, here on this list and elsewhere.

     2. Amazon didn't force this author to use their service. Clearly it's a
     net gain for her in the end; otherwise it was just a completely boneheaded
     decision to use Amazon, and she shouldn't be complaining. She should just
     stop distributing through Amazon.

She has two lousy options, she has surely chosen the less lousy one.
The existence of the other, worse, option does not alter the fact that
Amazon has put her in a bind.

I think I know why she chooses to sell through Amazon: because
otherwise many people would believe her books do not exist.  It seems
that many people look up books in Amazon, so if Amazon does not list
the book, they conclude there is no such book.  Thus, publishers feel
compelled to deal with Amazon even though sales through Amazon hurt
them.

Ten years ago, publishers didn't face this bind.  Amazon, through its
position, has made things worse for them, but that affects all of us.

To be sure, this is not as bad as other things Amazon has done, such
as using software patents for aggression, DRM, recording what books
people read, and participating in the dirty tricks campaign against
Wikileaks.  It is worth mentioning because it is in a different area,
and some people who don't care much about readers' rights or software
patents may find it tragic that small presses are harmed.

So don't buy a book through Amazon unless you despise the publisher as
well as your own privacy.

       3. Ebooks would be a great solution.

The article suggests that that publisher's books are designed to
appeal to the senses, not just to the intellect.  Ebooks would be no
substitute for those books.

I appreciate books for their content, not for their sensuality, so I
probably wouldn't pay the price for those books.  I'd be perfectly
happy with ebooks myself, if only they did not deny the readers'
freedom.

When I buy a paper book, I pay for it with cash, I don't sign a
contract that restricts how I use it, and I can read it without
someone else's secret decoder designed to restrict me.  The day when I
can buy all ebooks that way, I will be glad to do so.

That day won't come unless we fight for it, and my criticism of Amazon
is part of that fight.

					    There are plenty of ways to sell a
       book in this day and age. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't seem to work,
       but that's no reason to whine about it.

Nobody is whining.  She published an article to inform people about
one kind of harm Amazon does, and I am sending mail to inform people
of various kinds of harm Amazon does.  This is not whining, it is
pushback.

    On the topic that started this discussion: Amazon sells much more than
    books; I definitely won't be using the $20 gift card to buy books.

The Coop sells much more than books, and if these experiments gave
Coop gift certificates, people could spend them anonymously.
Experimenters should use that alternative.

    Also, to the best of my knowledge, ten years ago, publishers had
    complete power over authors.

Only in a theoretical sense.  There were thousands of publishers, and
they did not act as a body to exercise power.  In practice, this was
not an issue at all.

You are praising Amazon for curing a non-problem.

    Amazon can withdraw a book if it doesn't
    suit them from a political standpoint, but I think that happens less
    often than having a book rejected because it didn't appeal to some
    editor's religious beliefs or what have you.

If it was more common, it had little impact.  With thousands of
publishers, if one disliked your views, there was another who would
love the same views.  Chomsky found a publisher, and Limbaugh found a
publisher.  Theologians found publishers, and Dawkins found a
publisher.

You argue that Amazon is not a big censorship problem, and I think you
are right about that (at least so far), but that doesn't mean Amazon
is ok.  Censorship of books wasn't one of the criticisms I cited.

    I question the trend toward these "Housing as a Service" plans. Are
    users free to inspect and modify the floorplan? What ownership do they
    retain over the goods they place in this home? How do they know you
    won't track their usage habits?

    I say we protest this student's "subletdown" outside his office.

The parallel in form is amusing, but if you try to take it seriously,
you soon see that the issues about software and apartments are very
different in substance.  There are many differences, not least being
that it isn't an option to use your own edited copy of the apartment
instead of the original.

Another difference is that before computers there was little scope to
restrict or track people through their apartments.

Nowadays, it is possible to track people through their door locks --
if they are run through a computer system like the one in Stata
Center.  That's why I refuse to have the MIT card to open these doors.
I would pay attention to that issue when renting an apartment, too;
I would reject such a building.

      Once again, with all due respect, Richard, I am one of those mere 
    mortals who sell their books on Amazon, and I get a royalty!

All of us here are mortals, as far as I know.  Did you mean that to
distinguish humans from corporations?

You have given little detail about your dealings with Amazon.  I only
know that you sell books there and you get some money.  You referred
to it as a "royalty", which makes me wonder if Amazon is your
publisher.

With so little information, it is impossible to reach any solid
conclusions.  That you make money selling books through Amazon is no
basis to conclude that Amazon is good overall.  We can't even judge
whether Amazon is dealing decently with you.  Perhaps it is, or
perhaps not.

For sake of argument, let's suppose Amazon deals decently with authors
that use Amazon as a publisher.  That would not alter the things that
Amazon has done which attack our freedom, and I don't think it could
possibly outweigh them.

I had put a disused sofa in the corridor on the 3rd floor, and started
to ask various nearby groups if they wanted to use it.  However,
yesterday it disappeared.  Who has it?  I would like it to be used
somewhere near my office, if it is wanted nearby.

There are many ways to tax driving to discourage it.  Blair chose for
London the method that would also provide total surveillance, tracking
each car all the time.  He is now proposing to extend this to all of
the UK, where it would do what an increased gas tax would do, plus the
tracking.  I believe the real agenda is to make anonymous movement
impossible.

It's like the pox locks in building 32, extended to the whole country.




    All of the articles that I have read indicate that the congestion charge
    in the city of London was instituted by the Mayor, Ken Livingstone -- not
    by the Prime Minister Tony Blair, nor through any other involvement of
    British parliament.

I'm sorry if I was mistaken--but could the Mayor of London implement
such a thing without having Parliament pass a law?

    I have not heard of plans to implement a national congestion charge in the
    UK, although I could be behind on the news.

I read about this in an article from The Independent within the past
few months.




    i set my home thermostat to 68F, which i'll 
    admit is a bit cool for some people, but 72F should really be enough 
    for anyone. in the summer, 75F is fine.

Summer outside does not make a higher inside temperature comfortable.
On the contrary, it tends to mean higher humidity outside, which I
think results in higher humidity inside too.  That makes warm inside
temperatures such as 73F more uncomfortable than they would be in the
winter.




    I suppose Daniel's and my responses to the current settings illustrate
    the futility of effort to find one temperature level that will make
    several hundred people equally comfortable. Seems like having a larger
    range on the individual controls is a better solution.

I agree.  The old building's ventilation, despite its flaws, offered
a much wider range of possible temperature settings.

    Also, the door between building 36 and the Dreyfoos tower on the third
    floor is always left unlocked.

It is quite useful for that door to be open.  Please do not lock it.
It lets you into spaces which there is no reason to lock off ever.





    > It is quite useful for that door to be open.  Please do not lock it.
    > It lets you into spaces which there is no reason to lock off ever.

    Richard, your office door is locked!

Between my work place or your work place and the lobby, there is
another level of locked doors, within the building.  The additional
level of locked doors outside the lobby uses the same type of locks,
but more people can open them.  It does not make you any safer.
It is just a nuisance.





    Although you may find "the additional level of locked doors outside the 
    lobby" a nuisance, for other people this is the only level of 
    protection for them and their possessions.

This is not what we were told by CSAIL.  The official plans say that
there are at least two levels of locked doors in between everone's
workplace and the outside.  There is an inner one between the lobby
and CSAIL space, and the outer one between the lobby and the outside.
(I'm not counting the neighborhood doors, which people can climb
around.)  We're talking about the outer one.

Since you spoke only of "other people" without identifying anyone, it
is hard to be sure what you mean when you say that the outer level is
"the only level" for these unspecified people.  Are you saying the
inner level is ineffective?  That someone's workplace is outside the
inner door level?  Is 386a or 376 directly accessible from the lobby?

(Personal attacks intentionally left out.)








    I personally do not care whether the lobby doors are locked or not. 
    However, if they are locked, they should be locked for a reason.

If they are to be locked, it should only be for good reason.  But
there is no need to treat the lobby of building 32 any differently
from that of building 36.  Once in the lobby, people still cannot get
from the lobby into work areas at night.





    I think it's just unacceptable that there is always a easy path from the 
    outside (thruogh 34,36, Stata) to my desk.

I agree, but there was supposed to be a locked door between the
outside of your neighborhood door and the lobby (at night, at least).
Is that not the case for you?





    That said, you're actually in the middle of a non-locking area, right
    here at 386A.

When you call it a "non-locking area", you must be talking about the
"neighborhood" doors.  Sussman and Abelson do not lock the
neighborhood doors.

However, the entire warehouse space (which this is part of)
has locked doors separating it from the lobby.  So the term
"non-locking area" might give people the wrong idea.

(I think we should be able to get metal keys to open one of these
doors.)






    > Richard, I think the problem people complain of is that doors that remain 
    > open to places such as upper floors of building 36 connect directly to 
    > CSAIL space.

    Personally, I think that the problem is that most of the people
    who are complaining about doors being locked are people who have
    their own doors to lock, so they see the outer door as an
    unacceptable inconvenience. In most cases, the people who lack
    doors are not complaining.

Although you wrote this as a response to Peter's message, it does not
address the problem that he raised.  When I saw his message, my
immediate reaction was to take it seriously and address his point.
(That message should go out in the same batch as this one.)

While you falsely accuse me (based on speculative grounds) of not
paying attention to others' needs, you are the one who really
disregards the issue.












    Richard, I think the problem people complain of is that doors that 
    remain open to places such as upper floors of building 36 connect 
    directly to CSAIL space.

If that is the problem, locking the door on the 3rd floor, which leads
from Building 36 into the Building 32 lobby, will not solve it.  One
does not need to pass through that door to get from Building 36 into
those places on upper floors.

Instead of locking that door on the 3rd floor, the natural solution
would be locking the doors on the upper floors, which lead into from
Building 36 directly into CSAIL space.




I have some empty charlie cards available.  Please
come to rm 381 tomorrow, starting at 2pm, if you want one.

You can slide it under my door at any time.

    > If they are proprietary, participating in them means participating

    I suspect that, were you to poll the users of ITA software, you'd find
    that the vast majority disagree with that statement.

I have no way to guess what they might think.  I don't know what the
software does or who uses it.  (The original message did not say.)

I also don't know whether the software is free, or whether it is
proprietary; but I hope anyone considering going to work there finds
out.

Someone else told me that one of these programs is private-use
software, operated in a web site for finding flights.  Although many
people talk to the web site, only the web site operator is really a
user of the software.  There's nothing wrong with private-use software
as long as the client's freedom is respected.  Whether that is the
case here, I do not know.

The term "internet of things" puts a cheerful face on something that
is very dangerous.  You mentioned one of the dangers -- watching and
tracking people through walls.  However, there are many others.  These
devices normally are full of nonfree software, which communicates with
the manufacturer.  That typically means the manufacturer spies on the
user.  If the device has a chance to influence the "owner"'s actions,
it can manipulate the owner for someone else's benefit.

I hope that you will include treatment of these ethical issues in your class.

Let's swap zero-balance charlie cards, to thwart big brother.  If you
want to swap, please come to 32-381 next Monday at noon.

(I can also swap with you at other times.  Phone 3-8830 to see if I am
in.  I will be away Thursday morning through Saturday mid-afternoon.)





	Zero-balance charlie cards are essentially worthless.

That was true in January, but I am not sure it is true now, or that
it will remain true.

A few months ago, when I asked for a charlie card in a subway station,
an MBTA staff person told me that she had none, because they intended
to stop handing them out.  I think she spoke of a plan to sell them.
I am not sure to what extent they have implemented this out, but if
they have not finished it yet, they may do so in the future.

     If you
	really want to encourage trading, why not set up a publicly
	available charlie card drop-off/pick-up box, and eliminate the
	need for multiple parties to be available at the same time.

Leaving aside the question of whether getting one from the MBTA is
easy, people would be tempted to take one from this box without
leaving one.  It appears to me that this could be a significant
problem, and that's why I've chosen to have a swap-meet.

We're not limited to trying just one approach.  If you think I'm
overestimating this problem, and that your box approach would work
better, how about if you try it and see?  By trying both approaches,
we will see how well each one works.








    Call me paranoid, but I am worried that if we trade cards whoever gets 
    mine will be able to tell the MBTA that I work at CSAIL allowing them to 
    improve their service even more than they normally would with my 
    completely anonymous usage data.

Big Brother has not reached the stage of recruiting police informants
everywhere, so I think there is no reason to worry about this in
practice.  However, let's consider it as an abstract problem for the
fun of it.

Since I do not know you, you could trade cards with me without telling
me your name.  Then I would be unable to tell who I got the card from,
even supposing I wanted to.  I would not even know that you work at
CSAIL, since my message could have been forwarded to people who do
not.

    Do you think there is anyway we could eliminate this possibility?

Yes, if there are several of us.  We can put all the cards in a bowl,
then each take out one.  That way nobody knows whose card he got.




The sad thing is, that phone is a computer with lots of non-free
software.  And it's not in ROM, where one could say it might as well

Image a voice-based AI project designed to respond to robocalls
in such a way as to get a human being on the line and then waste the
person's time.

The user would activate it manually on discovering that the call
is a robo-call.

If it is free software, users would modify it in hundreds of ways, so
that the robo-callers would have trouble programming their systems to
recognize it.

Indeed, I can't access youtube these days.  In August, Google changed the
youtube pages so that you need to run nonfree JS code simply to navigate
the site.

If anyone here knows Javascript, would you like to write an extension to
substitute for that YouTube JS code?

Lenny sounds like a wonderful hack.  I wish I could hear one of those
recordings that are posted on youtube.

  > Apparently "Lenny" is implemented as some simple scripts in the Asterisk
  > open source (GPL) VoIP pbx software.

I wrote the GNU General Public License as a free software license, to
defend users' freedom (that's the aim of free software).  Later, when
others defined the term "open source", they came pretty close to
making coterminous with free software.  Thus, it is true that
the GNU GPL is an open source license.

But I didn't aim to make it an open source license.  That is just a byproduct
of making it a free software license.

See https://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.  See also https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-meme-hustler for
Evgeny Morozov's article on the same point.

I don't believe any web site is morally entitled to impose its
arbitrary choice of requirements on those who visit its pages.

The moral question is, which one carries more weight: Google's
unilateral demand, or your freedom?  I think your freedom carries more
weight.

That is true.  As the saying goes, freedom isn't free.

The good long-term solution would be for youtube to stop requiring
Javascript code.

Whether this is a good side-effect or a bad side-effect depends on the
values one judges by.  According to my values, it is good, since the
various powers the organization doesn't get are things nobody should have.

Contrariwise, if someone wanted payment for viewing a copy, through
some anonymous and libre payment system such as GNU Taler (taler.net),
I would not object in principle.  I have no objection to buying music
CDs (and I do so); this would morally be no different.

In the GNU Project we are committed to maintaining IceCat, our totally

IceCat is the start of the campaign to end those abuses, but not the
end of it.  We need to reject abusive web sites personally, and teach
others to do so.

I should have said, "I can't access youtube through the browser."

Youtube-dl is free software, and in principle I could use it.  But I
don't think of it as an option.  There are three reasons:

* For a while it seemed to really run the nonfree Javascript code,
which I won't do.

* The fact that I can't browse usually means I couldn't find
the videos I would be interested in.

* Even when I know the precise URL, the inconvenience of downloading
is generally enough to convince me not to watch it.

So I don't think of youtube-dl as an option for me.
But it is, strictly speaking, something I could do.

There are two significant differences between these two cases:

That's a totally different issue from the one I spoke about.
Why expect me to have similar views about the two?

To make my views explicit: I think it is legitimate to put ethical
requirements (such as copyleft) on a work.  See
https://gnu.org/philosophy/copyright-vs-community.html.

Youtube is not a publication, it is a publishing system.  A totally
different kind of thing.

However, antisocial requirements are illegitimate on a work, too.

I have an ethical philosophy by which I judge whether rules are legitimate.

If I think a rule is legitimate, I follow it, within reason, and I believe
others should follow it too.

If I think a rule is morally illegitimate, then I believe people have
the moral right to disregard it, and that includes me.

A rule can be legitimate in some cases and not in others.

Some rules are important for the sake of compatibility of our actions.
There is no inherent superiority for driving on the right, or on the
left; the importance is doing like others around you.  One could call
this "spontaneous moral symmetry breaking".

When a rule is important for the compatibility factor, more than
anything else, that usually convinces me that the rule is legtimate.

However, there are a few cases where I have refused to follow such a
rule, because I judged that other factors outweigh the compatibility factor.

For instance, POSIX specifies that du and df must present disk space
values by default in units of 512 bytes.  As soon as the committee
made that decision, disregarding my objections, I decided to make GNU
du and df display by default in units of 1k.

To get 512 byte units as the default, you need to set an environment
variable.  Its name was initially POSIX_ME_HARDER, but Bob Chassell
convinced me to call it POSIXLY_CORRECT instead.

Note: there are countries where everyone drives on the less rough side
of the road.

or any information from which those position data can be deduced?

A driverless car is not necessarily "self-driving".  For instance, it may be
connected, and take orders in real time from the manufacturer and/or the state.
Imagine if they send the order to lock the doors and take you
to the secret police station.

In order for a driverless car to be safe for you to trust, it must be
either (1) your property and run by free software, or (2) operated
by a car service and _not know who you are_.

I haven't seen that file but it sounds like that case is NOT free

That was never a widespread practice.  All the usual open source
licenses are in fact free software licenses too.  The only specific
instance I remember of source code that is open source but not free
is OpenWatCom.  (See https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html for
more about its license.)  I heard about a couple of other obscure
programs but do not remember their names.

For this and other points comparing open source with free software, see

You are not required to submit it in that particular way.  But you

  > The symposium is happening right now with some amazing speakers. It is streamed live at  https://helloworld.mit.edu/agendas/teach/live-stream-february-27/

I tried to look at the stream, at 11:42am, but the video did not
appear.  LibreJS reported that the page requires the user to run
nonfree JavaScript client code in per own computer.

Ethical leadership is exercized by actions as well as by words.  If
this is the sort of ethical leadership that the College of Computing
will provide, it will be detrimental.

We have well-tested free software for streaming.  It works fine for
people who defend their freedom, and for everyone else too.  So why
not use that?  Or at least offer it as an alternative?

It is too late to change this event, but the College of Computing
could pledge to use free software for future streaming presentations.

This protest is today.  Gout may stop me from walking there, but if
you don't have trouble walking, and you're not working on other
activism for freedom and justice, I encourage you to go to the Student
Center and participate.

I excised text that promoted Facebook and change.org.  Their concerns
address the importsnt issue of what ends computing serves, but they
seem not to recognize the important issue of computing means and how
those affect freedom, privacy and justice.

*What: **Kick Kissinger out of MIT and Boston!*
<http://ec2-52-26-194-35.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/x/d?c=3686056&l=d054bfc8-d7f6-4e6e-9a8c-c4b442328fd0&r=5be10a81-cb17-4160-8f5d-6688aa386958>
*Where*: MIT / Stratton Center 84 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA
(originally the protest was going to be held on Kresge Lawn, which is next
to the student center, but MIT put a massive tent there)
*When*: Tomorrow, 2/28,* 2:30-4:30pm*
*Poster Making Session 1:00-2:30pm:* Wiesner Gallery, second floor of MIT /
Stratton Center.
*Why*:

“THE ILLEGAL WE DO IMMEDIATELY. THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKES A LITTLE
LONGER.” - Henry Kissinger, in a meeting with Turkish foreign minister
Melih Esenbel in Ankara, Turkey. March 10, 1975

Come out to protest against the War Criminal and genocidal maniac who has
been invited to speak at about ethics (!) at the opening ceremony of MIT's
new Schwarzman College of Computing. Throughout his many years in the US
foreign policy establishment, Kissinger has proven to be a resolute enemy
of the people, best known for prolonging the Vietnam war, illegally bombing
Cambodia, helping topple a democratically elected government to install
dictator Augusto Pinochet in Chile, committing genocide in Bangladesh,
personally ordering the murder of foreign politicians, advocating for the
"dirty war" in Argentina, and numerous other atrocities. Since MIT has
decided to roll out the red carpet for this supposed "luminary", as it did
for crown prince MBS, it is incumbent on us to counter this act of
legitimization. So come out to make it clear:
*we wont forget, we wont forgive, and we wont be complicit in the erasure
of his crimes.*
But really, this is abut more than just Kissinger. MIT has made it
abundantly clear who this new college will serve: it will serve the
American war machine, it will serve the plutocrats, it will serve our
surveillance state. *This must be opposed, resolutely. *

*Come protest, and help us build a movement!*

I suppose that file contains either the X11 license or the Expat
license.  (Both of those are sometimes called "the" MIT license.)  To
avoid confusions about licensing, it is wise to put a license notice
on each source file.  Maybe you've already done that.

Does the file of Javascript that gets sent to the users carry a
license notice that LibreJS can recognize?  That is important because
many of us use software to detect and block nonfree JS code.

Would you please arrange for that file to indicate its license, and a
link to its source code (if the form that gets sent is minified or
compiled)?

Also, does the mavo-generated site function properly if the visitor
disables Javascript?

Using eventbrite for registration is harmful to the attendees
in two ways:

* It requires them to run a nonfree program in order to attend.

* It gives their personal information to a company, which will somehow
make it available for profiling them.

  > There is actually no need to register for the event.

To say this in the invitation would be a substantial improvement.
People reading that invitation won't realize that.  It says, "Get your
tickets", implying you must have one and you must get it from
eventbrite.

  > The platform also allow us to be discoverable at the platform to
  > reach as many as we can since this is an outreach event.

I don't understand why having a secondary page at eventbrite would
make you more "discoverable" than your own web site.  Won't they both
show up in search engines?

However, just posting a page of information on eventbrite is not doing
much harm or wrong.  The thing to avoid is asking people to register
through that page.  Is it possible to do the former and not the latter?

Does the Boston Globe have a calendar page which would post your events?
That would surely get you lots of visibility.

   > If you have a recommendation of a system that does this
   > functionality without offering attendee's data to a third party
   > please let me know.

The third party, in this case, is eventbrite.  Any system hosted
by someone other than you is giving the participants' personal data
to some third party -- the company that hosts it.

The way to avoid that problem is by running the system on _your own_
computers.

The Free Software Foundation has a simple system that it uses
for some of my events.  You could run it.

Talking to eventbrite subjects a person to three different wrongs:

* The site requires visitors to run nonfree software which is sent
in the pages.  That means the software is controlled by the company
and not by the people running it.  See
https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html and
https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html.

* They have to give personal data to the site.

* The nonfree software probably sends other data to various companies,
including eventbrite itself, perhaps Google, maybe dozens more.
It is usual practice for nonfree software to snoop on users.
See https://gnu.org/malware/proprietary-surveillance.html.

The Free Software Foundation's system avoids all these problems,
provided you don't add third-party surveillance to it (such as
Facebook "like" buttons or calls to Google Analytics).

Intimidation is one of the principal tactics of right-wing extremists.
For instance, the bully (president) does that frequently, hoping to
scare people out of opposing him.  When that works, they win.

There is no guarantee of safety in protesting, oe in crossing a street
in Cambridge.  But the danger is tiny and it is no reason to be
intimidated.

A couple of weeks ago I lost a copy of
The Origin of Objects, by Brian Cantwell Smith.
I may have lost it in Stata.  Has anyone found it?





    Does anyone know a good XML diff & patch (commandline) tool for Linux?

Such a tool could run on a GNU/Linux system, which includes Linux, but
it would have little to do with Linux, the kernel.

    (http://www.logilab.org/859) and "diffxml & patchxml" 
    (http://diffxml.sourceforge.net/) but they were either buggy or way too 
    slow even for the small XMLs (~200 kb)

If you could work on improving them -- or releasing a better and
faster tool -- that would be very useful.  Maybe adapting wdiff could
give good results.

The iBad and iMoan are jails for their users.  Apple's app store
forbids free software, so all the applications presented will
trash their users' freedom.

This is not something MIT should support.

Is anyone interested in organizing some sort of response?

    Richard Stallman's account must have gotten hijacked.  The real RMS
    defined Free Software, created the GPL, wrote GCC, Emacs, GDB, etc.
    Whoever is sending these emails, however, is more concerned with
    name-calling that's childish by fifth-grade playground standards and
    petty bickering about Linux vs. GNU/Linux.

27 years ago, I announced the goal of writing a completely free
operating system.  Then I wrote various essential parts of it.  I also
wrote licenses to release them under.  I also recruited other people
to do write other parts.  As a result, we now have a free operating
system which is basically GNU.

We also face the problem of computers that are designed not to let
people install and run free software.  And MIT is promoting these
computers.

We can't address that problem by just writing free programs.  No
matter how much free software we write for the iBad, Apple still won't
let users install it freely.

To fight this threat, we need political action.  And that's what I'm
asking people to join in.  The goal is the same, but the actions need
to change with the situation.


The message you quoted from didn't talk about the name of the free
operating system I started.  However, since you raise that issue, we
started the project so shouldn't we get equal mention?  See
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html.

    Leading by example, not using shame as a motivation for change
    (which very reliably does not work) and impressing upon people
    outside of the "choir" that Freedom is something actually worth
    having - those are the behaviors one would hope to see in place of
    antics and constant coat-tailing onto other people's email
    threads, talks, and so forth.

You seem to think it is wrong to criticize and condemn injustice;
that, in our efforts to end injustice, we should never publicly rebuke
the injustice, but should limit ourselves to setting an attractive
alternative example.

Apple's app store is a good example of why that isn't enough.  Apple
has forbidden the distribution of free software through the app store.
No matter how much or how good or free software may be, it won't
do anything to Apple.

If you look at campaigns against other forms of injustice, you will
see that public protest is a normal part, and a very effective part.
We need to stop limiting ourselves to improving our own free software
world, and start presenting our ethical/political message in places
and ways that other computer users NOT involved with free software
will see.

    What's even more terrifying than products that jail their users is
    the fact that so much of the current generation will choose
    convenience over freedom any day - akin to Cypher in the Matrix,
    they are happier in their jails with the illusion of comfort than
    facing the harsh reality of freedom. This is a direct effect of
    the transformation of cultures of citizens into cultures of
    consumers.

There you've hit the nail on the head.  But let's continue further.
Do these people reject the idea of freedom in general?  Maybe some do.
But I think that most of them still value freedom as a general thing.
What they have not done is said to themselves, "I face a choice
between convenience and freedom."  Rather, they find ways to downplay
and forget that the jail products take away their freedom.

So I think that we need to try to do actions that will make them
think about it.

    Better yet, how about just trying to stop painting freedom
    and convenience as mutually exclusive?

I don't.  I never did.  I think you took my statement out of context.

The context is certain specific products set up to deny freedom..  If
people like those products for some convenience, that particular
convenience is exclusive of freedom -- as long as Apple keeps its
current policies.

    Wrong. I think that people in a position of world leadership
    should not resort to infantile tactics like name calling.

"Name calling" can be an effective tactic, and it is only "infantile"
if humor is.  Of course, it is true that I don't superficially fit
many people's idea of what it means to be "grown up".  I think that is
true for many of us hacker.  But I don't think that is necessarily
bad.

     Whether you call it the "iBad" or the "iPad" has little bearing
     on the financial returns of the shareholders,

Indirectly it can.  It stimulates the anger of the people on our side,
and that helps in moving deyond debate to action.  Asking political
activists not to mock the enemy is like asking a coach not to say,
"Get out there and kick their ass!"

Also, if the mocking name catches on, it can hurt the enemy's image,
and image is everything to today's retail brand shell companies.

    but it does forge the public image of either the Insane Luddite or
    the Sensible And Wise Leader.

Since nobody could rationally take me for a luddite, if those are the
only two choices, I can only be the wise leader ;-).

More seriously, the wise leader is not always what you call
"sensible".  it is not wise to run a political protest campaign as if
it were purely and only an intellectual debate.  Star Simpson
explained this very well.

If many people here have an irrational prejudice against name mockery,
and systematically draw conclusions from it that don't rationally
follow (such as "Stallman is a luddite"), perhaps for the sake of
effectiveness I should cater to that prejudice.  But that is not my
first choice, because I hope that people will find it in themselves
to rise above the prejudice.  At least I owe it to them to give them
the chance.

    > If you look at campaigns against other forms of injustice, you will

    Correct. And note that no one is calling Khadaffi a "doodiehead" or an "iDictator".

It isn't necessary; nobody in the US is seriously defending him.
There is no need to try to stain his spotless purchased image, since
that job is thoroughly done already.  Everyone agrees he is evil; the
debate is only about how best to deal with that evil.

I expect, however, that Libyan rebels frequently call him names a lot
nastier than "doodiehead".

By contrast, some organizations I support were talking for a while
about the "banksters" that caused the housing bubble and took
lots of wealth from Americans without getting punished.
On stallman.org you can find links to articles about systematic
fraud by banks against homeowners in foreclosure proceedings.

The banks' control over US government policies has not been weakened
like Gaddafi's control over Libya.

    My argument is that many people who have lived their lives
    swimming in various freedoms for which they personally have not
    fought don't see it.

You are right about that.

    Since when does humor stimulate anger?

My statement was taken out of context.  The point is that mocking
Apple's product names can help people who already resent Apple's jails
to feel more angry at Apple.  It can help their anger crystalize.

He also compared my persistence to Gov. Walker's persistence, which is
sleight of hand again.  What's bad about Gov. Walker is not his
persistence, but the fact that his aim is to attack the people of
Wisconsin.  By contrast, I asked people here to join in fighting
Apple.

There are more such fallacies in his message.

    Richard, have you ever considered the possibility that you might be wrong,
    or at the very least considered backing away from a particular tactic?

How would he know how often I admit mistakes?  I don't confess my
errors to hostile strangers.  He made up an accusation, never mind if
it is true, and phrased it as a nasty question.  Simple verbal abuse.

I don't treat Apple as harshly as he is treating me.  I condemn Apple
based on facts you can all check.

His question was not serious, but I will give it a serious answer
anyway.

I often consider that I might be wrong.  However, I know that insults
from hostile people do not imply I am wrong.  I sometimes back off
from a tactic, but only for a good reason.  If supporters of the cause
criticize it, that might indicate a flaw in the tactic, but I need to
find out what they think and see why in order to draw conclusions.

When a crowd of adversaries say that my methods are lousy, and that
the proof is their criticism, that doesn't prove anything about my
methods.  They are just being adversarial.

    I don't think that is what people are saying.  I belive they are
    simply saying that ad hominem attacks and other logical fallacies
    weaken an argument rather then stengthening it.

Fallacies are invalid arguments, but there were no fallacious
arguments in my message.  Indeed, there were no arguments in it.  That
message was not about arguments.  It was a call to action, addressed
to people already convinced that Apple's products are an injustice.

Calling Apple's products "iBad" and "iGroan" does not prove they are
bad.  I did not try to prove they are bad, because I did not want to
start an argument about the question.  I just wanted to find people to
help in a protest.  Others started the argument.

Let's be clear about hat an ad hominem attack is.  It means saying, in
debate, "X's position P is false because of something bad about X."
This is invalid because, even if X is evil, that doesn't prove P is
false.  (For instance, Dubya probably believes that 1+1=2, but that
isn't false.)  Talking about whether something is bad about X is
wandering from the issue of P.

But I am not debating with Apple, I am trying to defeat Apple.  I am
saying, "Apple is hurting users' rights; let's fight to stop it!"  So
when I present arguments -- which I've done elsewhere -- that Apple's
products are evil, that is not wandering from some other issue.  That
is the issue.

Thus, when I say "iBad", that is not an ad-hominem attack.  That is
name-calling.  Of course, name-calling is not a valid argument either,
but I don't present it as an argument.  It is an action.

If we want to change something, we must do more than just convince
people with arguments that it is unjust.  We must organize them to
take action.

Sometimes the action can include presenting arguments to other people
so as to convince them.  Clearly we can't convince them by saying th
product is the "iBad" -- we need to show them arguments, and we do.
However, it can't hurt to also make them laugh (and many do!) by
talking about the "iBad".

    The problem with the specific malapropisms

Doesn't "malapropisms" mean errors?  My words were intentional.

					       "iBad" and "iGroan" and
    "Losedows" is that they *sound stupid*.   They exist in a kind of 
    linguistic Uncanny Valley that makes people cringe when they hear
    them... 

I can't understand why anyone would respond that way.

	    thus not cringe because of political outrage, but cringe
    because they sound stupid.  And that stupid sound upsets the people
    here who already believe the message, because as the underlying
    message resonates with them, the medium makes them feel like *they*
    sound stupid.

In my speeches, many people laugh at these jokes, and they love our

If someone here _supports the cause_ but feels as Matt describes,
could you please talk to me about it?  Off the list, perhaps.

    It's hard to convince someone that Free software is a great thing
    when freedom itself is not valued or even understood
    anymore. Seems like that's the right problem to tackle, not
    belittling the jailers.

It's not a choice of one or the other.  Each has its place.

You're right that teaching and leading people to value freedom is the
center of the challenge we face.  When I argue for free software, such
as in my speeches, I focus on this.  (See audio-video.gnu.org.)

Mocking a company's brands is a tactic.  In a group of people who are
angry, it helps get them angry enough to go and do something.  It also
hurts the company directly.

It also seems to rub many of the readers of this list the wrong way,
so I won't use those mocking names here any more.

Some have told me that because I used mocking names here, and didn't
post arguments here, they concluded I "had no arguments except for
name-calling".  I post the arguments in http://www.gnu.org/, so if you
would like to judge my arguments, please look for them there.

    The GNU project should (and does) get the credit for its contribution.

We launched the development of this free operating system, we stated
the goal, and then we pushed in every possible way to reach it.
We convinced Berkeley CSRG to release its code from BSD as free software.
We also wrote many essential pieces of the system ourselves.

The word "contribution" is an understatement when applied to these
facts.  It recognizes our writing of specific pieces, but not the
other things that we did, even though those were bigger and more
fundamental.

Please give the GNU Project credit as the initial and principal
developer of the GNU/Linux system.  Please don't call the system
by a name that doesn't mention "GNU".

      As a result the damage to the FSF cause due to
    "Linux" having stuck instead of "GNU/Linux" is less than the damage
    done by trying to claim credit in the name.

I disagree, but can we avoid arguing about this tangent?  The issue at
hand is not about the FSF strategic decisions.  It is about what you
should do to treat the GNU Project decently.

MIT is planning an event to promote developing software for Apple
products which are designed to serve as jails for their users.

Apple's app store forbids free software, so all the applications
presented in this event will disrespect their users' freedom.

This is not something MIT should support.  It calls for a protest.

What I have in mind is a nondisruptive protest, with signs and
leaflets to inform people who come to the event.  That would be enough
to have an effect.

    The App Showcase will be held on *April 13th from 6-8 PM*.

I would organize this protest, but I will be out of town then.  Would
someone like to organize the protest?

An editor from Science is going to give a talk to make us eager to
publish in that magazine -- and to disregard the fact the magazine's
policies that don't allow redistribution of your article.

I hope lots of people will go to the talk to raise that issue -- to
pressure that journal (and all the rest) to practice "open access" as
it was originally defined in the Budapest Declaration (which includes
a license for users to share copies).

"Open access" is no longer a suitable rallying point for the issue,
since people have since redefined it not to include freedom to
redistribute.  It could be called "redistributable publication."

    Dropbox and other services and/or internal CSAIL storage may be a good  
    idea as a backup service for everyone.

Please don't use Dropbox!  Dropbox requires running nonfree software
(Javascript code in the web page), and if you don't run that, it
does not work at all.

CSAIL's file servers are a good solution.

Dear Richard:

As this year's seniors graduate, please join Student Debt Crisis and other
organizations and stand in solidarity with students and families
struggling with student loan debt by wearing a special ribbon during the
commencement season.

Let us know if you can put on a ribbon, snap a photo of yourself wearing
it, and send it in by clicking here.

If Congress doesn't act by July 1st, the interest rate on federal student
loans will DOUBLE, costing more than 7 million students $1,000 more per
loan, per year.

Let's work together to put a human face on student loan debt, and to make
sure access to higher education remains a priority for the students of
tomorrow by raising awareness about the burden of loan debt today.

We're collecting photos of borrowers, students, and families wearing the
ribbons to put a face on student loans and to encourage Congress to stop
the rate hike.

Learn more and download your ribbon by clicking here.

Thanks, and congratulations to this year's graduates!

Sincerely,

The Student Debt Crisis team

    Not true. Dropbox has an API, and provides MIT-licensed client libraries
    for using it from many programming languages.

I stand corrected -- I only tried it through the web site.
However, you shouldn't trust your private files to any company.

Is there any free/libre program that a user can use to access
something in Dropbox?  Without writing a program, that is?

    The other nice thing is that your files are encrypted, and opaque to
    the company (downside: if you lose your password, your files are gone
    forever).

Does it let you do the encryption with free software in your own
computer?  If so, I think it can be trusted.

    Yes.  If you call M-x list-packages in Emacs 24 with the Marmalade
    repository,

What is "the Marmalade repository"?

    Sadly, I was absent-minded enough to include no licensing information in
    the source, but I will fix this shortly; if you do not mind, it will carry
    an MIT license.

(That term is ambiguous -- see
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html.)

Please license it under GPL version 3 or later, like Emacs.

    In contrast, for example, Tarsnap (whose client is not free software,
    so I can't endorse it, but at least it has public and very well-
    written source code) breaks each file up into chunks on boundaries
    that vary from client to client and are hard for an attacker to
    predict, encrypts each chunk using AES-256 in CTR mode, and affixes an
    HMAC-SHA256 authenticator to each chunk so that the server can't trick
    you into thinking you stored data that you didn't.

If there is any such service that has a public API that would allow
people to write a free client that does these things?

    Perhaps there's now turn-key Free Software that can do encrypted backups 
    to a variety of cloud storage providers (or to one's own remote storage 
    hardware, if one prefers)?

Please let's not call them "cloud", because that nebulous term
confuses this with other totally unrelated services.
See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html.
"Remote storage services" is a clear way to describe this
which doesn't convey a mistaken idea of similarity to other things.

    Parts of SpiderOak are GPLv3;

Are they GPLv3-or-later or GPLv3-only?
The latter is a bad idea, since it will cause license incompatibility
if we ever have to make a GPL 4.

				  they claim to be working toward having
    their libraries be entirely FOSS:

This is a good thing to be working toward, but while the software
is nonfree, you can't trust it.

So why don't they publish an API now and let people write their
own clients?

    Regarding this page:
    http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html

    I'd love to see the licenses laid out as a big table, because it's not
    immediately clear what features are provided (or missing) in each
    individual license.

I think this is easier said than done -- even the question of which
"features" to include in the list is not clear to me.
If someone wants to take a stab at doing this, we could see if

    This project creates new interaction methods for electronic
    devices surrounding us in our everyday life.

This is a very dangerous line of research.  You can focus
on serving people and not abusing them, but when real companies
make real products based on your ideas, we cannot expect them
to show the public such respect.

When we see "The Internet of Things", we should read "The Google of
Things", "The Facebook of Things", "The Department of Homeland

    I believe that being conservative about instrumenting Things is *more*
    likely to lead to silos and panopticons.

I believe you have the wrong model of how our developments might
influence future production.

     If some geeks across the
    street give breadmakers IPV6 addresses and web interfaces, then all
    the other geeks can figure out ways to use them.

    And if DHS sticks a clipper
    chip in every bread machine, then the protocol will be both
    undocumented and illegal to use.

We can't influence that by developing an Internet-controlled
experimental breadmaker today.

You are arguing that if we "get there first" we can shape
what "there" looks like.  That is true only in some ways.
Because it's not really the same "there".

If and when tens of thousands of people buy breadmakers with Internet
addresses, those won't be made by geeks working on their own.  They
will be made by companies, and designed to do what the company wants.

They will probably have web interfaces, because companies will
consider that desirable.  But that will be neither here nor there as
regards the danger of surveillance and back doors.

If you make the first Internet-controlled breadmaker, and you add a
useful feature, later company-designed breadmakers might preserve that
feature to make users happy.  In other words, your possible influence
on the company operates through compatibility.

Such influence will not extend to avoiding back doors or spy features,
because adding those is not an incompatibility for the user.

Meanwhile, unintentional bugs can be exploited even if the
company acts with good will.


There are only two ways we can prevent these problems.

1. Totally firmly insist on using _only_ free software in breadmakers,
and teach others to do the same.  (This does not prevent bugs, and in
some circumstances it reduce to #2.)

2. Reject Internet-controlled breadmakers.

By following one of these policies, we protect ourselves.  But we help
others only to the extent that we lead others to adopt the policy too.

Since nobody really needs a breadmaker to be on the Internet,
I think #2 is a better approach.

    I think there's another option which is also challenging, but not quite 
    as challenging as either of those. (Those strike me as simply 
    impossible.  I don't see how one group of people insisting as you 
    suggest is going to stop another group from paying for the products you 
    want to prevent.).

The way you have put it, with the word "stop", you have changed the
subject.  There are many things people can do that would have an effect
on how many people participate in the Internet of Things, or how much.

* Simply by NOT working on the Internet of Things, you help hold it back.

* By teaching people to beware of the danger, you help them resist it.

Neither of these would count as "stopping another group" from doing
something, but they would help address the problem.

    I think it might be possible to market Internet-controlled breakmakers 
    with a key selling point being that users have total control of all the 
    data the breakmaker ever gathers.

This will be possible when it is possible to make Internet-controlled
breakmakers and sell them to the public.  If you do it this way,
you could get the FSF's Respects Your Freedom endorsement.

To achieve the goal in an effective way, you would need to set up a
company that is owned by people who are firmly determined to make
ethical products.  If the company is controlled by investors, they
would change the policy if that seems commercially advantageous.
They would give priority to the "success" of the company over
its achievement of the goal you have in mind.

If you want to work on that, please do.  However, if you are NOT
working on that sort of project this year, please look for some other
way to help save us from an Internet of Things controlled by companies
that work with Big Brother.

    Merlin is underway with the goal of developing a system that uses

The application I have in mind is to selectively feed the birds that
are beautiful to listen to, such as blackbirds.  But I wouldn't want
it to harm other birds, just not offer them food.

Perhaps there could be a barrier across the opening which opens when a
bird is recognized as welcome, and shuts when there is no bird
present.

For the sake of users' freedom, would you please take care to ensure
that all the features of the web site work without running JavaScript
code?  And that any JavaScript code which does get sent to the user is
free software (i.e., is explicitly and clearly marked with free
software licenses)?

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html.

For the sake of users' privacy, it would also be good to make sure
that nothing is loaded directly from any other site, so as to avoid
giving anyone else information about the people who visit your site.

Also for the sake of users' privacy, it would be good to announce that
people can register anonymously and pay their fees by money order.  I
just convinced a conference I will speak at in July to allow people
to register and pay anonymously.  These rights will disappear if we

    I have used it a lot and it works great. The only thing is that you cannot
    have more than 8 (or 16?) parallel threads by default and it doesn't
    support multiple servers. But they have a diff library that you can buy (it
    was called Matlab Distributed Computing Server (MDCS)) which goes up to
    many more machines and threads (and works great too) but that one is
    *quite* expensive.

I wonder if this is an artificial limit made specifically to
cause artificial trouble, so people will pay to overcome it.

    You can compile your code as executable using MATLAB mcc compiler (CSAIL
    has license). Compiled version do *not* need licenses at all. You need have
    mcc and MATALB licenses during compilation only.

That point could be convenient for someone developing a proprietary
application, who plans to let users have only an executable.
For someone developing free software, though, it would not help anything,
since the users would expect to compile it as well as run it.

Giuliano's program may be meant for only his private use.
If so, neither your point nor my point would affect his project.
Still, since one has been mentioned, the other ought to be.

    In many cases it will already have been done, and it may be cheaper to
    buy ebooks (pdf or otherwise) than to pay someone to do the scanning.

The problem with buying ebooks is that commercial ebook distributors
do several unethical things to the users, of which DRM is only one.
They usually impose EULAs, and require users to identify themselves.
See http://stallman.org/ebooks.pdf.

If you can find a commercial PDF without any of these problems,
there's no reason to reject it.  But otherwise, what you get from
those companies is ethically inferior and nasty -- scanning the book
gives a better result.

I suggest not mentioning Amazon pages to refer to products.
See stallman.org/amazon for why.  There are other places to order
headphones.

But then, how about buying them from a local store?  That way, you can
pay cash and not be tracked.  And you can help local stores stay in

Just recently it became possible to program an FPGA using free tools.

The FPGA supported is the Lattice iCE40.  I suggest rejecting

Since Android uses Linux as kernel, I am pretty sure that when you say
"Linux" you don't really mean Linux.  You surely mean the GNU system
in its GNU/Linux variant -- right?  Would you please use the name
"GNU/Linux" to refer to that?

It's inaccurate to call our work "Linux".  I led the development of
the GNU operating system, and a lot of the early work in the 1980s was
done in the corridors of the AI Lab, on the 7th floor of 545 Tech
Square.

It is also strangely inconsistent.  When you refer to our system, you
treat that kernel as everything, disregarding our work; when you refer
to Android, which contains the same kernel, you don't even mention the
kernel.

  > Or, you can mentally replace Amazon with Purse.io, a site that lets you buy
  > Amazon products with bitcoin.

Does purse.io avoid the need to identify yourself for
shipping?  And does it work with stores other than Amazon?
If so, I would like to know more.

However, you've changed the subject.  You're proposing another way
that someone who receives a reference to an Amazon product page can
buy the product (from Amazon, in this case).

There are other ways to use that URL without buying from Amazon.  For
instance, look at the product at the Amazon page, then look for other
places that sell it and buy from one of them.  I've found products in
physical stores after looking at them in Amazon.com.  This is
turnabout for what Amazon did to bookstores, yay!

But I raised a different question: not how to respond to such a URL,
but whether to send it.  Not how to buy products, but what ways of
purchasing to suggest to others.

If you send people an Amazon URL (I don't mean you personally -- you
didn't send one), some of them will make a point of not buying there.
But, you know, not everyone will.  Even some people who have a bad
feeling about Amazon may tend to follow the easiest path.  If you make
purchase from Amazon easy, you lead some to buy there.

Thus, citing the Amazon URL is promotion of Amazon, and even if some
resist that, it will still be partly effective.  I suggest avoiding
that outcome, for the reasons given in http://stallman.org/amazon,
by not citing Amazon URLs.

The choice of Chrome as a platform is unfortunate because that is

To reduce the information Big Brother collects from T riders,
it is good to swap charlie cards from time to time.

I have several slightly used but empty charlie cards on hand.  If you
would like one, come to my office, room 381, from 10am to 4pm on
Tuesday.

I'd also appreciate it if you'd drop off empty charlie cards, either
Tuesday or before or after.  You can slide them under my door if I'm
not in.

If you have a charlie card that isn't empty, you can come and pick up
a new one for future use.  When your old card becomes empty, switch to
the new one and give me the old one.  I'll use it and/or circulate it.

An RFID can be scanned at any time and in any place, so keep your
charlie card in a pouch of aluminum foil or mylar except when you
want to use it.

Remember, only you can keep Big Brother in the dark.







    To reduce the information Big Brother collects from computer users,
    it is good to reduce the amount of email sent (e.g. email about wanting
    to swap charlie cards...).

If you are suggesting that we keep events under wraps, I think that
would be counterproductive.  If we stop announcing seminars, Big
Brother won't find out about them, but neither will the people who
want to attend.  Likewise for charlie card trading sessions.




If you use a phone associated with your name
to pay for a charlie card, will the MBTA system
connect the card with your name and thus keep track
of where you have been?

I am pretty sure that they can do this if you buy the
charlie card with a credit or debit card, which is why
I always pay cash.

This suggests a way to campaign for change in the way they distribute
these files: go to the billing office and say,

  Would you please print my bill?  I can't read it on line, because they have
  put it in an obscure format that my software cannot access.  I hope you
  will pass the word that they should fix this.  They used to send bills
  in simple ordinary PDF format that I could read on my computer.

If they ask you what the bad format is, you can answer something like,
"An obscure variant of PDF.  It requires special Adobe software that I
refuse to trust.  It is conttolled by Adobe, and I dont trust Adobe
one micron."

The more students that do this, the more effective it will be!

Please confirm for me: browsers running inside MIT will not be allowed
to communicate directly with web servers outside MIT via SSL?

Won't browsers block MIT's attempt to pass off its own certificates
in place of those that belong to the servers in question?

Very clever!

						Idea for a protest sign:

That won't get the message across very well.  Most people won't
read it carefully enough to get the point.

I suggest a simpler approach:

call it MITMnet
explain why
denounce it
demand that MIT change this

I suggest arranging a delegation of students and faculty
to ask for a meeting with the president next week.

That is too cryptic for me, and I don't understand it.
You seem to be addressing your words to people who know all about HTTPS
and certificates; people like me, who are not experts on that,
can't understand.

My undersanding is that when I visit a web site using HTTPS,
my brower and the server talk directly using encryption, which
I believe is SSL.  Are you saying that this is NEVER the case?

It sounds like that, but since you are speaking in a cryptic way,
I can't be sure what you mean.

It is a positive step.  However, the most crucial point is not access.
It is to permit redistribution (i.e., mirroring) of articles.

In the 90s, I asked an official of the ACM why the ACM had a
restrictive publication policy.  The answer I got was, to support the
high capacity "digital library" they had set up.  I pointed out that
if they permitted mirroring, they would not need a special high
capacity server, that an ordinary PC would suffice.  Alas the problem
had to be preserved so as to justify the solution.

    Also, I wonder whether this ACM "author-izer" is at the advice of legal 
    counsel, is a courtesy, or is a compromise between people who think 
    articles should be free and the ACM's desire to have some "exclusive 
    content" for revenue purposes.

I expect it is all three.  They surely got legal advice about how to
do this, but the lawyers would not have told them to do this.

It is certainly a limited courtesy to the authors.

I suspect that the main motivation for doing it was to try to appease
the pressure for the ACM to do freely redistributable publication.
But since it does not get all the way there, we should not let down
the pressure.

I've published occasionally in ACM and similar magazines.  I insist
they publish with my copyright notice and a license statement
permitting redistribution.

    As good practice, I would also be a tiny bit cautious of a "new student 
    group" initiated by unknown or unfamiliar parties.  Even though it's 
    probably legitimate in origin, and benign, a record of association with 
    some group could conceivably create a headache for me later.  The 
    actions of a single person spread taint through graphs of associations.

This is good advice for people who want to get along under a tyranny.
However, if the aim is to avert that tyranny, this sort of fear is
exactly what would get in the way.

Political issues are important because they can hurt lots of people.

In a civilized country, that cashier would have to fear dying from
cancer, and painful treatments, but no more.  In the US, thanks to
political policies that favor corporations over most people, she must
also worry about how to pay for those treatments.  If the
Massachusetts program provides her with health coverage, she might
still be unable to afford the deductibles and copays.  If she can't
work because she is ill, would she be unable to get food?

Unjust devices such as the iThings won't kill you, but they can hurt
you quite a lot.  And if you're a dissident, digital surveillance can
put you in prison (on false charges, if necessary).

We may be able to overcome these injustices by focusing our effort on
them.

Keep in mind that these social communication apps involve giving lots
of info about you to a centralized server which reports to Big
Brother.  By contrast, you can go to a store and pay cash, and no data
base will know where you are.

Sending mail to a local mailing list with selected people who might
be able to help is also better.  It doesn't have to keep any logs,
and in any case, those logs are only kept locally, not given to a
centralized server run by a company.

Arbitrary inevitable unfairness can be compensated in various ways.
The three could agree on the 40-40-20 division, then randomly choose
which one will get the 20%; that would make it fair, in the sense of
unbiased.

Inequality causes problems even if it isn't due to a priori bias.  To
avoid the inequality, those who get 40% can pay compensation to the
one who gets 20% to make up for the unequal division.

Society has ways to limit overall inequality, even if various specific
activities create inequality.

web sites and neglecting the user's own security against them?  Is it
a good idea to use these "web applications" at all, given the data
collection they do?  Should we tolerate an "exokernel" designed to
allow web sites to run their nonfree renderers etc. in our browsers,
on our machines?

But I can't be there.  Is there someone else who would like to raise
them?

    I don't think protesting is a very
    diplomatic way to address this -- and in this instance at least there will
    probably be zero effect

A well-organized protest is an effective way to show that Gates is not
the benevolent "philanthropist" he is seeks to present himself as.
More importantly, it can inform the public about the harm that his
business (and parts of his "philanthropic" activities) do.

Further, it is an opportunity to educate people about proprietary
software in general.  Proprietary software is unjust regardless of who
does it, but Gates is a prominent proponent and symbol of proprietary
software, so his visit is an ideal chance to raise the issue.

The ethical side of computing education is just as important as the
technical side that classes teach, so I hope many Course 6 members
will participate.

			    other than making some members of our department
    look ungrateful for Bill Gates' financial donation to the construction of
    this building.

Gates' main activity has been separating computer users from their
freedom through proprietary software.  Compared with that, his
contribution to building the Stata Center is a minuscule point.  Let
us not blow it up out of proportion.  Our judgment of Gates should be
based mainly on his principal actions, and should be affected only
slightly by his other minor actions.

This is all the more important seeing as these minor actions were
apparently intended to contrive society's forgetfulness of about his
principal actions.  To the extent that our society permits such
efforts to succeed, it grants impunity to many kinds of exploitation,
which encourages more of it.

I do not hate Bill Gates, but I do not want society to encourage any
more like him.  If I were in town today I would definitely be at the
protest.

    Proactively expending energy to create better software than what Microsoft
    has to offer has much greater potential for effecting positive change.

Based on 26 years of experience, I disagree.  I have seen that
competing on those purely practical terms means neglecting the deeper
aspects of the issue.

We seek to win freedom for software users (ourselves and others).
Above all we must teach them to recognize what freedom means in
this context (see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
and start to value and demand it.

Informed citizens who value freedom will know better than to choose a
proprietary program, even if it "better" in a solely practical sense.

Making free software easier to use and more reliable helps us win, but
that's not enough by itself.  We should not mistake that subgoal for
the overall goal.  If we focus solely on practical convenience values,
we encourage others to do likewise.  We need talk about values, not
just technology.  A protest today will provide an opportunity.




    While I agree with some of your ideals, tomorrow Bill Gates is speaking as
    Bill Gates the philanthropist, not Bill Gates the Microsoft co-founder.

These two activities are inseparable -- the money he uses to buy a good
reputation is the money he obtained by increasingly subjugating
computer users.  He would like us to judge the good and ignore the bad.
So would everyone else who does a lot of bad.

Meanwhile, I think some of the "philanthropy" consists of encouraging
children to become Windows users.





    That battle was mostly won years ago, and MS can never regain all the 
    ground it lost, nor can it behave like it used to.

I think you've overstated our success.  95% or so of desktops and
laptops still seem to run Windows.  

Microsoft's behavior is changing, but not for the better.  Each
version of Windows is more restrictive than before.  It has gone from
threatening software patent lawsuits against free software to filing
them.  Just a couple of years ago it corrupted ISO's processes to
impose a patented "open standard".

Microsoft is not the only company that mistreats software users.
In fact, Apple is pioneering even nastier practices.
Apple is indeed the leader in subjugating users today.
We picketed the launch of the iBad, and got useful attention
for the malicious aspects of the product.

But if Apple is the most vicious enemy of the users,
Microsoft remains their biggest enemy, having subjugated
over 90% of PC users.  It is far from defeated.

We protest Apple and Microsoft, and we protest other DRM companies
too.  The problem of proprietary software is bigger than one company,
and we need to use all suitable occasions to call attention to it.  If
Jobs were visiting, that would be a good occasion to protest.  Gates'
visit is a good occasion too.  The more attention the visit draws, the
better occasion it is for us to educate the public about the issue
that most media don't mention.

If he wishes to present himself as a "philanthropist" and asks people
to forget how he made is money, we have no obligation to go along.






    The situation is even worse if you're perceived as a beneficiary of his 
    donations to MIT (and let's not get into the percentage of people who 
    believe that MS gifted us with most things computer up until Google). 
    While he's perceived as a wildly successful person who did great things 
    and now recognizes a noblesse oblige in helping millions of the world's 
    neediest... you're perceived as the ingrate teenager, freeloading in the 
    house that he paid for, and criticizing your parents besides.

Those are the thoughts of a person who has been totally misled by
Gates' PR.  Such people may exist, and it would be very hard to reach
them.  Fortunately, there are others who are not so deluded to start
with.  Those are the ones we have a chance of reaching.

So we may as well not bother about what the deluded ones will think.


  




    What do you think about the extensive open source software
    contributions that Apple has made with its Macintosh platform?

Even after Apple adjusted its license to make these programs free
software, they did not advance the Free World much, since they did
jobs that GNU/Linux could already do (and maybe BSD also).

Even if Apple released the entire Mac OS system as free software it
would do nothing to nastiness of the iGroan and the iBad.




    > I notice that these are all complaints related to the iPhone/Pod/Pad,
    Apple's newest development space. For many years, the Apple Macintosh was a
    closed platform as well, but is now mostly open.

That may be true in some ways, but Apple never went as far in
restricting Mac users as it does now with the iBad.  For instance,
Apple never required all Mac applications to be distributed through
Apple alone.  Apple never had a back door to forcibly install changes
in the Mac or to forcibly deinstall applications.

     Perhaps lobbying for a
    Darwin equivalent to the iPhone OS would be more productive and less
    perjorative?

If Apple released the lower levels of the iBad system as free
software, that might imply solving the problem.  Because in order for
the _binaries_ to qualify as free software, the users must be able to
install and run their own versions if Apple can do so.  (See
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.)

However, if Apple makes these levels "open source" without making them
free, the change might have no effect whatsoever on these problems.




    His affiliation with his former gigantic company aside, how is Bill 
    Gates not a philanthropist?

"Philanthropist" implies a benefactor of society.  To get money by
subjugating people and give some of it to a good cause does not
qualify.




      He would like us to judge the good and ignore the bad.
    > So would everyone else who does a lot of bad.
    >
    I repeat: sunk costs.

Proprietary software is an injustice, not a mere "cost".  Digital
Restrictions Management, which Microsoft encourages and practice, is a
further injustice.  Software patent lawsuits are another injustice.
To treat at them as "costs", sunk or otherwise, is a conceptual
mistake.

And the injustices are continuing, not past.

    I care about free software. But I care more about children dying of
    preventable diseases.

It's a false choice: you can contribute to curing the diseases in many
ways that don't legitimize nonfree software as a byproduct.

    > Meanwhile, I think some of the "philanthropy" consists of encouraging
    > children to become Windows users.

    And fixing that, rather than complaining about the past, seems to me to be a
    more effective and PR-positive way to work this issue.

Microsoft has many ways of quietly buying support for Windows (of
which might the Gates Foundation might effectively be one).  We don't.
So the way we try to change the practice is by rousing public demand
for change.  Protests contribute to that.

If you think you have a chance of persuading the Gates Foundatin in a
"friendly" way to support education using free operating systems,
please go ahead.  They would be less unlikely to listen to the message
from you than from me.  Meanwhile, our outside pressure will give them
more reason to listen to you.






    What you said, "the money he uses to buy a good reputation is the money
    he obtained by increasingly subjugating computer users", is only
    partially true--Warren Buffett gave 30 billion to the foundation

Gates should not get off the hook because others give him additional
money to hand out.

    Or is the objection that Gates simply did bad things, and we shouldn't
    let anyone forget that? If you think that, I guess it means that if he
    he were here to switch teams and promote free software, you would still
    have to protest him because he once was in charge of microsoft? 

The goal is to end the injustice, and we criticize Gates as a
practitioner and advocate of the injustice.  If Gates were to recant
his previous advocacy of the practice, and campaign to oppose it, that
would really change the situation.

A small side activity of free software would not change things much.
In fact, Microsoft does develop some free programs, but they are not
much when set beside the harm Microsoft does.  (Also, I think they
only run with Microsoft nonfree software, so they promote the latter.)

    I spent a little time trying to be utilitarian about
    it: the Gates foundation website says it has given out 22 billion since
    its inception. Recent estimates put the cost of, say, all of Fedora 9 at
    around 11 billion, the linux kernel around 1.5 billion.

What is wrong with Microsoft is not that it makes a profit, but that
it does so in an unethical way.  Giving away some of the profits does
not make it acceptable to continue this.

I am not sure how to interpret the "cost" figures for Linux and
GNU/Linux, but what is important about them is not the amount of work
that went into them but rather the good they do: they make it possible
for us to use computers in freedom.  That is impossible with
proprietary software.






    With all due respect, some of us here at CSAIL don't really have an 
    option about using MS office or Windows. Our jobs lend themselves to 
    having to work with MS documents on a regular basis whether we like it 
    or not.

"With all due respect" indicates disagreement, and that puzzles me
because I don't see any conflict between your message and mine.  Your
report about your job situation is evidence that confirms the power
Microsoft has, and that's what we protested.

I hope that you participated in the protest, so as to push back
against the harmful circumstance you report.

It should be noted that being compelled to use Word files does not
necessarily require using Microsoft software.  OpenOffice can handle
most Word files.

However, convincing people not to send them is better than accepting
them, and even if you can't convince all of them, you may be able to
convince some of them.  We could have a discussion off the list to
plan how to do this.




    Sorry I was unclear; I wasn't speaking of market share nor of Free 
    Software.  MS used to be an unholy terror -- ruthless and underhanded -- 
    towards competition, partners, and even customers.  MS has since been 
    neutered by alternatives and the shift from desktop to Web.  CIOs and 
    ISVs with a sense of history are careful not to let MS have major power 
    over them again.

That doesn't jibe with what I've read about Windows Vista and Windows
7 (see windows7sins.org).  It seems to me that Microsoft is tightening
its grip.  Perhaps changes of different kinds are occurring in
parallel in different areas.

I don't think this affects the conclusions.




    At the risk of spinning completely off topic, I ask the rehtorical
    question, how can anyone aquire enough money to be a noted
    philanthropist through societally benificent means? 

By inheritance, I think.  Maybe there are other ways.  Fortunately we
don't need to answer that broad, general question in order to think
about a specific case like this one.  The details do matter.

    In an attempt to bring things back around I'd ask, given he has taken
    this money out of society, shouldn't he be encouraged to put it back
    in some reasonable way?

I think the first priority is to stop the taking.







    In another hypothetical situation, would you still oppose his ill-gotten 
    gains if he contributed money not to global health and international 
    development, but to free software?

That wouldn't change the conclusion.  Proprietary software creates a
system of unjust power over the users of that software.  For the
developer to spend some of the gains on a good cause (health care, or
free software, or whatever) does not excuse treating the users that
way.






    I'm talking about you -- that's YOU, Richard Matthew Stallman, founder of
    GNU and FSF, Saint of the Church of Emacs, et cetera -- making *and
    enforcing* (with that tenacity we are all familiar with) a joint statement
    with Bill Gates...

I think it is more effective to spend my time on avenues that seem
more likely to result in success.  Also, the idea you proposed would
focus on the usual set of values (cost savings highlighted and not
freedom), and my goal is to teach people to change those values.
This educational project could have some good results if it were done,
but I'd rather it be promoted by others, so that the cause of freedom
does not have to lose one of its main spokesmen.




    > This educational project could have some good results if it were done,
    > but I'd rather it be promoted by others, so that the cause of freedom
    > does not have to lose one of its main spokesmen.


    I must confess to being confused by this last statement. How would the cause
    of freedom lose one of its main spokesmen?

If I started talking about cost savings and its consequences instead
of computer users' freedom, I would no longer be a spokesman for the
cause of freedom.

We who value freedom are a small minority already in the free software
community; most of the community endorses the purely practical values
of open source.  So it would be a big loss if I stop promoting them.
I have also learned to avoid making those compromises which help
take one step at the cost of removing the subsequent impetus to take
the next step.

    There are certainly talks the the average computer user must out
    source (My grandmother is not running a mail server) and equally I'm
    sure there are or could be applications too demanding for users of
    modest means that could be very beneficial to provide in a SaS type
    model.

A mail server is not SaaS, since what the mail server does for you is
not _your own computing_, but rather communication with others.
That communication cannot be done entirely within your computer.

Mail service is an important issue, especially now that a US court has
ruled that the police can subpoena your email from a company without
even showing you the subpoena.  It is also a particularly difficult
issue, since ISPs generally won't let users receive or send mail
directly with their own machines unless they pay a lot extra.  In
other words, your grandmother is vulnerable, and she faces obstacles
beyond just whether she has the requisite knowledge.

Fortunately the issue at hand -- the issue about converting this free
software plug-in into a SaaS server -- is easier than the mail server
issue.  It can be addressed simply by releasing the plug-in already
developed, rather than changing it to SaaS.

    sure there are or could be applications too demanding for users of
    modest means that could be very beneficial to provide in a SaS type
    model.

Today's computers are quite powerful, so in order for a computation to
be feasible in a server but not in your own computer, it must be
pretty heavyweight.

     (the other challenge is to keep people from being seduced into bad
     ideas by fancy marketing, but that is a more generalized problem...)

One way is to reject the marketing buzzwords which are designed to
lead people's thoughts away from important issues.  For instance,
"Cloud computing".

Programmers love to generalize.  The term "cloud computing" encourages
people to try to generalize to the max, and disregard the difference
between various issues (such as the plug-in vs SaaS issue and the mail
service issue).  Programmers who love to generalize even without
encouragement are very likely to fall into the trap.

To promote careful thinking about each issue, we should choose
terminology which does not encourage overgeneralization.  That is why
I don't use the term "cloud computing" any more.  Whatever I say, I
want to say it about something sufficiently specific.




Is DynamoRIO free (ziyou) software?




    That depends. I've certainly never, in my personal life, needed more
    computation than my computer has. But it doesn't take much to tax a
    netbook, yet alone an iPhone.

The iGroan is a thoroughly malicious product, full of proprietary
software, locked down, with back doors.  If it were a country, it
would be Uzbekistan.

				  And I can't run a Pandora-equivalent (or
    any crowd-sourced application, for that matter) on my own.

I am not familiar with Pandora, but if you're talking about something
where lots of people contribute to it, like Wikipedia, that's a
different issue from Software as a Service.  That's not your own personal
computing, that is a collective activity.

    David's suggested coming up with a GPL style license for Software as a
    Service providers. Every issue you have raised against SaaS can be
    fixed, generally via contract and otherwise via new laws, so as to
    maintain freedom.

You are certain these problems can be fixed, but I see no chance of
even trying.  How can you control your own computing when it is done
on a machine where you cannot change any software?  So I have a
feeling we are miscommunicating.

But I'd be glad to discuss it with you to see if you have found an
avenue for a solution.




    Richard -- if you had bothered to visit the link Qin Zhao posted in
    his message, you would have seen the following right on the front
    page: "DynamoRIO's source code is available under a BSD license."

If it were as easy as that, I could have done it.  My access to web
pages is by sending mail to a server which does the equivalent of wget
and mails them back to me.  (Once I get the page, I can view it with
various browsers.)  I transfer mail a couple of times a day and
usually have no net connection otherwise.  Browsing this way is for
desperate circumstances only.

But the main reason for asking the question on the list is because no
discussion of a program is complete without it.  To maintain freedom
requires paying attention to freedom.  I hope others will get into the
habit of thinking about the freedom question when they think about a
program, and talking about it when they talk about a program.







I don't remember whether we have released the page-fetcher mail demon
script yet.  I will ask.




    If we receive positive feedback, we intend to  
    come up with a version that does not require users to install stuff in  
    their browsers.

Firefox has a simple plug-in mechanism that makes installation as easy
as pie.




Yenta sounds like just the right architecture for doing many sorts of
collaboration and communication.

If you don't want to write another such program now, perhaps the CSAIL
people working on related projects could do it.  There are also GNU
Project activities that are aimed in this direction; for instance, for
doing the same job as Skype.




Social networking sites are useful, but they also have problems.  See
http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jan/14/facebook for a
description of bad things about facebook.  I don't think these
problems make facebook so bad that people should boycott it, but they
are not insignificant either.  It's not good to promote facebook
without warning people about them.

A few months ago, the FSF began using facebook to communicate with
free software supporters.  I decided that, when we tell people that we
are using facebook, we should also inform people about the problems of
facebook, and say that we are not intending to urge people to use
facebook.  This way, the FSF can tell facebook users about the FSF's
facebook page while remaining neutral on whether people should use
facebook at all.

I recommend that CSAIL adopt a similar approach.





      The only way they
    know of to deny the network to viruses which trick users is to deny the
    network to users.  My take-away was that FB agrees it shouldn't be
    locking people in, but that unlocking people isn't their highest
    priority either.

This does not seem like an adequate excuse for conduct which, in fact,
does lock users in.




    MIT is working on a better system than this, but the plan hasn't
    been completed and put in place yet.

Would that be a better system for letting people in when the system
fails, or a better systems of locks?

I am skeptical of claims that metal keys would be more trouble than
this system is.  We made them work adequately before.  Maybe it was
not perfect, but this isn't either.  The assumption that this is
better than metal keys must be doubted.

Meanwhile, has everyone been around to visit Sussman and Abelson's
neighborhood, where they arranged for everyone (except Hal) to have a
lockable office door with a reliable metal key?




    And we should probably remove those helpful "this way to Gates"/"this way 
    to Dreyfoos" signs from the third floor immediately, as they only aid 
    those with ill intent.

We should remove the signs "This way to Gates" and replace them with
signs saying "This way away from Gates".  It's important to indicate
which direction people ought to be moving.





I think it would be useful to start a Free Software Activist Group
within CSAIL.  The idea would be to promote free software development
and use within CSAIL itself.

If you're interested in participating, please write back to me off the
list.




It often happens nowadays that solving problems with computers creates
a problem of surveillance.  The idea of sharing cars a la Zipcar is
basically a good one.  However, it has the side effect that it keeps
permanent record of when each person is using a car.

Taking note once in a while making of what some person is doing is not
a problem--it's an inherent consequence of interacting with other
people that have memories.  However, as more and more human activities
are designed so that they *always* record what everyone does, it
transforms the situation into one where Ashcroft (or is it Condi now?)
watches everything.




Someone should mention, in this talk, that Microsoft uses the jobs in
its facilities as instruments to buy or bully governments into giving
Microsoft what it wants--which can be quite harmful to everyone else.
See the message below.

If Microsoft asked me to help find employees, I would decline to help.

Hello

I thought i might mention this, since it just reached our 10 o' clock
news. Apparently Bill Gates said to our government during his visit that
they would shut down the danish CRM part that they bought a couple of
years ago, and move the 800 jobs to the states if EU didn't pass the
directive on softwarepatents. And the two governmentparties (Venstre and
Konservative), are now working for that to happen. This looks like the
war is beginning to get even dirtier....

I would not expect ordinary individual doctors to tinker with medical
software.  And it makes sense to have safety testing requirements on
versions that are to be used for treating people, just as there are
roadworthiness requirements for cars.

But that doesn't mean the medical community can't make, test, and then
use new versions -- in careful ways.

I think groups of doctors, paying attention, are qualified to do this.

Indeed, that is possible.  But that means that each user (each
physician or hospital) can only modify things separately -- they are
not allowed to collaborate as a group.

  > First, few if any hospitals have the computing resources to do it.

The resources to run the system should suffice to test it.
Lots of hospitals and clinics run GNU Health, so it is apparently
not that much resources.

Someone else reported that hospitals pay for lots of local
customization of the commercial packages that they use -- so they have
the money to pay for this.

There are several gaps in that argument.  I will point out a few.
1. They had development staff before, so they could now.
2. Changes can be big or small.  Many useful changes don't need
hundreds of staff.
3. Hospitals could pool their funds or staff for a larger change.

Subtle change of topic.  I was talking about making modifications, not
developing a system starting from scratch.  That is not needed -- we
already have a free EMR system in use.

I agree that using only medical practitioners to do all the work,
hiring no software developers, might be inefficient.  I did not mean
to suggest that.  Sorry if my words were not clear.

There is some research that is better not done, and I think this
is an example.

How would you deal with the possibility of computers with microphones
"deeply embedded" in the walls of your home or office?  Or inside your
body?  Could you detect their presence?

I think these systems pose a danger of expanding repression.
Even though these systems offer substantial practical benefit,
that is insignificant compared with the repression.

If I were going to be in town on Jan 30 I think I'd write and
distribute a one-page handout about the danger.  Does anyone else
want to?

Batteryless Intermittent Computer Systems 

Speaker: Brandon Lucia

Abstract:
The emergence of extremely low-power computing components and
efficient energy-harvesting power systems has led to the creation of
computer systems that operate using tiny amounts of energy scavenged
from their environment.   These devices create opportunities for
systems where batteries and tethered power are inapplicable: sensors
deeply embedded in pervasive civil infrastructure, in-body health
monitors, and devices in extreme environments like glaciers,
volcanoes, and space.  The key challenge is that these devices operate
only intermittently, as energy is available, requiring both hardware
and software to tolerate power failures that may happen hundreds of
times per second. This talk will describe the landscape of
intermittent computing systems.  I will briefly describe our newest
programming and execution models that are robust to arbitrarily
frequent power failures, providing a simple programming model and
reliable intermittent operation.  I will discuss our latest hardware
platform, Capybara, which enables applications to dynamically
provision energy to different parts of an application.  I will close
with a discussion of our recent work on intermittent deep neural
network inference and a recent deployment of an intermittent computer
system work to the International Space Station.

I've shown that your arguments have gaps, and I stand by what I said.
Adding an ad-hominem attack won't close the gaps.

When they pay for customization of EPIC software, I presume they are
paying for all of this.  That shows they can afford to pay for
customization done this way.

Your argument tries to count this factor on only one side of the
comparison, but it counts on both sides, so can be divided out.

Billions of dollars could pay for a lot of work on free software.

You compare the judgment of physicians and clinic administrators

Dismiss whatever you wish, but others may not be so cavalier about the
medical professionals that disagree with you.

I think you've changed to a different question.
"Pricing risk" is not what the issue is about.

We know from many countries' experience that a national health system
provides better care, and costs the public much less money.  Sorry, I
don't have a URL to provide, but the comparison between the US system
and the Canadian system (which covers all citizens, at least) is easy

It is not meaningful to describe a programming language as "open
source" -- or as "free" -- because those terms apply to programs,
not directly to languages.

Thus, a compiler can be free or nonfree.  If there are multiple
compilers for a given language, it is quite possible for some to be free
and some to be nonfree.

C is an example.  There are free compilers for C, including GCC and
LLVM.  But there are also nonfree compilers for C, including nVidia's
proprietary modified version of LLVM.  The fact that LLVM is not
copylefted is what enabled nVidia to keep the instruction set secret
and thus block the development of free C compilers for their machines.

So, is C a "free" (or "open source") language or not?  That kind of
question has no answer.

I wonder how it plans to "collect data on a larger scale."

surveillance, and I suspect that if we knew the details we would
want laws to stop it.

  > Moving sale! everything negotiable, must pick up tomorrow 6/12

It's too bad you posted this in Google Docs, because people can't
see what you posted unless they run Google's nonfree JavaScript code.

It's better to put the list in your message itself.  That way,
everyone can see it.  The length of the list, if represented in plain
ASCII, is probably trivial compared with the other things people
receive in email.

  > I'm not sure it matters; it's pretty obvious that the fridge is running

That was not obvious from the posting:

    Moving sale! everything negotiable, must pick up tomorrow 6/12
    Smaller things like clicker/rice cooker I can deliver on campus, but fridge needs to be picked up from 70 Pacific street.

You must be referring to something in the file I could not access.

Whether I'd consider it a reason to reject the refrigerator, neither
of us knows.  I know where I draw the line, but I don't know what
the seller said.  You know what the seller said, but you don't know
where I draw the line.

Furthermore, person said there were other things for sale.

The issue here is bigger than that one sales offer, which has
concluded already.  Offering household items for sale on this
list is a regular form of use.  It is important to educate people
to avoid the habit of putting their offers into web sites and
thus gratuitously pressuring people into running nonfree software.

Google Docs has a moral downside, and I contend that outweghs
a handful of extra messages.

Posting the list in a simple web page is a fine method.
It has no moral downside.  But you need to have a web site

Only a fraction of people would refuse to run the nonfree JS code
required to see the Google Docs URL, so I am not surprised that you
found buyers.  I don't suppose you suffered practical loss.

If that is the sole criterion to judge by -- if one disregards
fairness, respect for freedom, and the question of what values one
teaches to others -- then this method could seem just fine.

But we should not disregard those things.  I suggest that they
are perhaps more important than finding a buyer for a fridge.

If that works, publishing the reference this way is a fine solution

I'm sad to say that this platform too requires the visitor to
run nonfree software in order to see the photos.

Would you please post your photos in a directory in a simple, ordinary
web site and email the directory URL?

Paradoxically, Google Docs might actually be better, since Robert
Rusch <rusch at mit.edu> reported a way to generate a URL that people can
view Google Docs pages without nonfree software.  Assuming it works
for some sort of collection of photos.

Perhaps there is a such a solution for the service you are using.
Does anyone know?

  > google is almost surely running nonfree software to respond to web
  > request,

Google runs that software; I don't.  Thus, Google is the user whose
freedom it either respects or not.  I would not claim the right to
change the software _in Google's servers_ even if it is free.  It is
Google that is entitled to that right, not me.

Anyway, I doubt Google servers run much, if any, nonfree software.
Remember that free software does not have to be released.  I expect
that Google is running on its servers a free operating system, either
GNU/Linux or BSD, plus Google's own unreleased software.  The latter
is free, in a trivial sense, because each user of it has the four
freedoms.  (There is only one user of that software, Google, and it
has the four freedoms since it is the copyright holder.)

Users have no direct reason to be concerned with what software Google
runs in its servers, or whether that software is free.  What affects
users of Google services is the servers' _behavior_.  For instance,
they collect data about users, which does harm to users.

The situation where we need to be concerned about nonfree software and
Google is when Google asks _us_ to run some software on _our_
computers.  In other words, for client software that Google sends to
us to run.

What I said is that leading or pressuring people to run nonfree
software is doing wrong to them.  I didn't say "unfair" since that
would mean something else.

At this point your message jumps to a different issue.

								  I find

It is incorrect to equate "posting without nonfree JS" with "posting
on one's own web server" with "posting on a server in your home."

There are services you can post in that allow people to see your
postings without running any JS code.

Another jump to a different issue:

  > We can take a smartphone out of our pockets, take pictures, paste the
  > pictures in a google doc, and share the link in ~60 seconds. 

I could try to guess what argument you're trying to make, but it's not
a good idea to guess.  Since you didn't state an argument, I don't
have to refute one.

That is not a "strategy", that is a wish list.  I wish for them
too;unfortunately, they are easier said than done.  Do you want to
help, by working on them?

      A lot of
    things are unfortunate in 2018; what's the plan for staying relevant
    (and attractive as an option)?

Something really important, such as freedom, is always relevant
to life.

I generally agree with your message except for one point.

Most of the people who adopted the term "open source" in 1998 hoped
they could make the free software movement fade away, but they didn't
succeed.  We still campaign for respecting users' freedom.

Open source was the same thing as free software in regard to practical
work such as writing code.  The difference is in the philosophy.  The
free software movement values freedom and says that a nonfree program
does an injustice to its users.  "Open source" avoids raising that
issue; it presents matter in terms of practical values only.

See https://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html.

Thus, to the extent that I can influence students, I will influence
them to contribute to free software.

  > If only there were some organization that could take Free software and
  > cloud hosting seriously at the same time.

The term "cloud" is too nebulous to be the basis for a clear
discussion.  It lumps together practices that raise entirely different
issues and that we should always discuss separately.

The only real cloud is in the minds of users that that marketing
term in their thinking.  See https://gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html.

Using someone else's server to publish something seems ok to me in
principle.  The only issues are details, such as whether it requires
you to run nonfree JavaScript code to publish something, or requires
visitors to run nonfree JavaScript code in order to see what you
published, or tracking who views what.  Those are issues of details.

By contrast, storing _unpublished_ data in someone else's server may

If I rented a virtual computer, I would insist on running only free
software on it, just as I do with my physical computer and for the
same reason: so that it remains under my control.

Thus, I would refuse to run the Google Docs nonfree JavaScript code on
my virtual computer.

The problem for Google Docs seems to have an easy solution: send
people the Publish URL.  However, the general issue remains for
some other web sites.

My response is that I feel this community does not respect freedom
much.  Last year it set up a web site which requires visitors to run
nonfree software for various operations.  Now it has posted a survey
which can only be answered by running nonfree software.  That will
exclude responses from people who think computing freedom is important.

Respect for freedom ought to be given enough priority that no project
neglects it.

I disagree.  I think you're defining "relevant" the wrong way.

To define relevance in terms of convenience means, in effect,
declaring freedom irrelevant if it requires a sacrifice.

I think freedom is worth a sacrifice, and I will try
to convince others to join me.

What I had said was,

Reading your response, I didn't recall talking about fairness because

The term "cloud" leads you to think of these two cases as similar,
then you find it anomalous that I hold different views about the two.
However, I don't consider them similar at all.  I don't think of
either of these scenarios using the term "cloud"; I reject that term
because it tries to generalize about disparate cases that we ought to
consider separately.

If I rent a computer, real or virtual, that's my computer (for as long
as I rent it), and I demand full control over what it does.
That requires running only free software it.

When I talk over the net with your computer, I don't think I am
entitled to control over what your computer does.  It's yours, not
mine.

I think you deserve full control over what your computer does, which
means running only free software in it.  I will encourage you to do
things that way, but I am not going to insist, and I would never think
of refusing to talk with you until you do so.  I have no reason to do
anything like that.  If you are running nonfree software, that is your
loss of freedom, not mine.  I'm sorry for you, but that is no reason
to shun you.

People keep imputing to me extreme views that I don't hold, and being
very surprised that I don't hold them -- even calling it a
"contradiction."

If you stop modelling me as an "extremist", you might find my views
more comprehensible.

It is hard for me to concretely grasp the scenario you have in mind.
I won't use the term "cloud browser", but since I don't know what
you intend to refer to, I can't come up with a substitute.

I don't feel that I am making a sacrifice by rejecting nonfree
software and spy devices.  I feel that I am protecting myself.
To use nonfree software would be a sacrifice and a surrender.

Most of the time, rejecting nonfree software is not difficult, just
different.  It is only once in a while that I have to forego something
enjoyable because its price in freedom would be too high.

That would be really nasty, but if you look at what I really do,
it isn't like that at all.

I don't criticize users for being novices, I don't insist that they do
things that are hard.  I don't approach users with demands and
rebukes.  Mostly I educate users that their computing practices are
harming them in a way they were not aware of.

I don't make demands of users, but occasionally I implore a user to do
something differently.  For instance, to put a list of items for sale
in the message text rather than in a Google Docs page.

That is different but not hard.  Everyone who can send an email knows
how to copy some text file into the message body.  I ask them to do
so, in a polite tone.  They don't know why that way treats others
better, so I explain.

I do sometimes make moral demands, but not addressed to users.  I
address them to developers, managers, and others responsible for
developing systems that will treat users right or wrong.

To use a cooking analogy, that would be like a master chef who demands
that other chefs follow proper sanitary practices so that they don't
make diners sick.

You're making the implicit supposition that it's all or nothing.

  > While "open source" certainly started the way you describe, that's not how
  > it is used today. Today, the word "open" clearly refers to freedom. Open
  > governance. Open hardware. Open source. Open society. Open meeting laws.

With all due respect, I think you are mistaken for the most part.
Most of these terms do not refer to the same freedom that "free"
refers to.  They refer to something else, in some cases overlapping,
but not the same.  Often "open" stands for a weaker criterion than
"free".

An open society is not the same idea as a free society.  Open
hardware is not the same idea as free hardware designs.

It doesn't make sense to describe governance or meetings as "free" or
"nonfree".  It does make sense to describe them as "open".  This is
because the two are different, and the stronger meaning of "free"
doesn't fit with those two issues.

The two terms stand for a different attitude, too.  The term "open"
suggests an enhancement rather than a right.  This is why "free
software" and "open source" are so different.  It is easy for
companies to advertise their software has an "open source community
edition" (which means the principal version is NOT open source, nor free).

If a company advertised a "free/libre community edition", that would
be risible.  The idea of "free" is too strong and clear to tolerate
this.

If people that use the term "open source" state support for ideas of
freedom, that's good.  But it tends to be limited or partial support.
I doubt you will find people that use the term "open source" and say
that a non-open-source program is an injustice and that "all software
must morally be open source".  They are talking about roughly the same
programs as we are, but what they SAY about those programs is very
different.

https://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
explains these points.

[[[ foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example. ]]]

The aim of the free software movement is to liberate the users of
computing; that is, to give them control over their computing.
ALL users of computing.  This is everyone's right.

The way users have control over their computing is by having
control over the programs that do their computing.  That means
all people should do their computing with free software.  See
https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html.

To achieve the goal does not require that all people be adherents of
the cause.  In a theoretical sense, it does not require any adherents.
We could imagine a paradise in which people have this right and it is
never threatened, so it never needs people to defend it.

However, we know that freedoms tend to be threatened, and that
to protect them we must defend them.  That would call for a substantial
number of supports of the cause, though it wouldn't be necessary that
everyone support it or even that everyone think about the question.

The free software movement has achieved quite a bit, more than people
believed in the 1980s was even possible.  (Back then, many said, with
sincere regret, they were sure we could never achieve a complete free
Unix-like operating system.)

But there is a long way to go.  Look at all the people using nonfree
operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS and ChromeOS.

Look at all the mobile phones, each communicating with the phone
network using a nonfree program that has a universal back door to
convert the phone into a full-time listening device.  Look at all the
nonfree apps, many of them designed to spy on users, restrict them
with DRM, and/or screw them using back doors.  (See
https://gnu.org/malware/ for details.)

Look at the devices of the Internet of Stings, which are mostly
designed so users must talk with them through the manufacturer's
server.  The server keeps a dossier on each user, and in many cases
does nastier things too.

We have achieved quite a bit, but until we have liberated everyone
from these forms of injustice, our success is not complete.

  > Me, i'm willing to wear socks that have been woven with machines

What software is in those machines does not directly affect you and me
as users of socks.  To liberate all users includes liberating the
sock companies -- their computing should not be under someone else's
control -- but at least we can wear the socks without their affecting
our freedom.

The issue will be different if socks start containing computers.

CSAIL should lead on this by insisting that its web sites be developed
so as to work if the user does not execute client-side Javascript
code.  (Or, at least, if the user executes only the free client-side
Javascript code.)

I've never tried to pressure or coerce anyone into not running nonfree
software.  I present reasons why your freedom depends on that; what
you do with that is up to you.

CSAIL web sites, by contrast, does pressure people, almost coerce
people, to run nonfree software.

CSAIL is not alone.  Nore and more web sites do this, in a mostly
gratuitous denial of freedom which in total is very harmful.

CSAIL should change its policy and set an example of respecting your
freedom.  I can't bring this about on my own.  If some of you join in,
maybe we can do it.

It would be nice to do better than this, but it is easier said than done.

1. We don't have a lot of money to hire people do design software.

2. Often we need to talk with hardware whose specs are secret.
Proprietary system developers don't have a problem; they use
proprietary drivers that are binary freeware.  We can't use those
drivers because they are not free/libre.

3. Many of the seductively "convenient" computing activities involve
running large servers, that must be expensive to run even on rented
virtual servers.  Worse, what they do involves snooping on people,
and we wouldn't want to do that.

Ideally we would replace these centralized services with P2P or
distributed architectures.

That doesn't make it impossible.  Would someone like to work on
implementing such systems?

At this moment, refusing to carry a mobile phone is the only way to
avoid being be constantly tracked and, if someone wishes, constantly
listened to.  So refuse is what I do.

Society has got into a very bad situation on this issue.  Please don't
shoot the messenger who reports this situation to you.  It's not my
fault that to have freedom, as you would have taken for granted 20
years ago, now requires this.  I'm not the one who set up the mobile
phone system, and I can't magically change it, either.

I have been, however, encouraging people to work to change it.  There
may soon be substantial progress.  A phone is being built that will
stop most of these nasty practices.  The one it can't stop (not while
being able to receive communication) is tracking of movements -- but
there is a technique you could use to stop that most of the time.

You're trying to reformulate my views in terms of concepts that are
not the ones I use.  That won't give you a reliable model for the
conclusions I will reach about subtle cases.

I draw the line based on who is running the program and whose
computing it does.

When my browser talks to your web server, I run my browser, wich does
my computing.  You run your server software and the computing it does
is yours.  I don't think this is controversial.

I don't make a fuss about what software you run on your server,
because I think that is your business, not my business.  I think you
should have control over your computing, but that is only a wish.

  > 1. you log in to my computer (because anyone at CSAIL can)

Many years ago, I used CSAIL computers to browse.  But after I became
aware of the issue of nonfree Javascript, I became uncomfortable with
letting the browser run that, and started to disable Javascript when
using those machines.

You make those ideas sound rather ridiculous.  I'm glad I don't
advocate ideas like those.

I don't boycott companies merely to give them small "incentives".  I
don't boycott companies for being the victim of nonfree software.  I
don't even boycott companies for developing nonfree software (though I
reject _that software_ since it is nonfree).

I fo boycott companies for gross injustices.  To get an idea of what
would qualify, see these pages in stallman.org: amazon.html,

They don't say "free/libre", and this edition is not free/libre, so I

mean "gratis".

What about the other two editions, "standard" and "premium"?  Is

So I don't think this conflicts at all with what I said:

If you find an example of a "free/libre community edition", I will be

source community editions" are many, my point about the different
implications of "free/libre" and "open source" will still be valid.

The burden of proof is on you.  You're the one making the unlikely
claim.

If you've seen the OSI state that users are entitled to certain
freedoms, show me (us?) the text where it states that.  I will look it
over.

I do note that your imperious demand is ambiguous.  Does "as defined

  > If you visit my web server to fetch content,

Please let's not call the publications on your server "content",
because that deprecates them, and all other publications too.  I may

The question is, "whose computing is that?"  It is a hard problem
and after years of though I don't have a complete general answer.
I have only partial answers, for certain ranges of scenarios.

But I am sure that the question has nothing to do with "who caused
that code to run at this moment."  That's not what this is about.

We're talking about the scenario where your server retrieves things
and sends them to visitors.  That's a kind of scenario for which I am
sure of the answer.  I consider that scenario like a conversation
between the two parties.  When I write these words, that's my mental
activity.  When you read them and maybe respond, that's your mental
activity.

Thus, when my browser sends a request to your server, that is my
computing.  When your server responds, that's your computing.

The injustice of nonfree software is that it denies users freedom to
control how their computing gets done.  If there is nonfree code in
your web server, _to whom_ does it deny control?

Not to me!  I am not the one who deserves control over how your server
responds to requests on your behalf.  Since sending a request to your
server doesn't harm my computing freedom, I don't mind doing it.

If your server runs exclusively free programs -- _your_ copies of free

We were talking about comparing the free software movement's position
wth the position that "open source" means.  Your response changes the
question -- it is not a response to the point I made.

You did a similar thing here:

  > I believe you will find similar attitudes among many users of the term
  > "free software" as well.

Look at the preceding conversation.  You said

  > While "open source" certainly started the way you describe, that's not how
  > it is used today. Today, the word "open" clearly refers to freedom. 

I responded

    If people that use the term "open source" state support for ideas of
    freedom, that's good.  But it tends to be limited or partial support.
    I doubt you will find people that use the term "open source" and say
    that a non-open-source program is an injustice and that "all software
    must morally be open source".  They are talking about roughly the same
    programs as we are, but what they SAY about those programs is very
    different.

You came back with

  > I believe you will find similar attitudes among many users of the term
  > "free software" as well.

talking about people who use the term "free software" but don't
entirely support the free software movement.

We were comparing the free software movement with open source, and
partial supporters only partially reflect the movement's stance.  So
they are not pertinent to the question.

The free software movement says that a nonfree software is an injustice
to those who use it.  The open source idea doesn't include that.

  >    6. Vocally state that people who write or distribute non-free software

Partial supporters of the free software movement are giving real
support -- real partial support.  Sometimes their partial support is
helpful.  I won't reject it.

However, that's a tangent.  We were discussing what software movement
stands for and how its philosophy differs from that of open source.

We mostly agree, but there is one point I would like to correct.

    Richard is in a uniquely
  > privileged position of having enough people around to help him ensure
  > this happens all the time.

I think that sentence gives people the wrong idea of the causality.
It is not that I started firmly resisting nonfree software because I
had special support.  Just the reverse!  When I set out to resist
nonfree software, I was basically alone, with a few friends that
sympathized.  By doing this work, I built a community that enables me
to do much more.  All of you can be in it, too.

(Now I am addressing everyone on the list, not Taylor specificaly.)

I reject communication through nonfree formats and protocols and JS
code for three reasons (ordered by increasing numbers of people
influenced):

* So they don't take away my own freedom.

* To convince those who lead/pressure others in that direction
  to stop doing so.

* To educate others about the issue.

In other words, I am not just avoiding mistreatment of me personally.
I am seizing the opportunity to help steer various people and
organizations away from harmful practices.

Can all of you "afford" to do the same?  Of course!  If you are
reading this, there occasions where you can say, "I'd have to run a
nonfree program to read that file / access that page / communicate
with you that way, and that would do me wrong; please post / send me
the XYZ format since that works with free software" and have a chance
of influencing others.

I succeed in this some of the time, not always.  But I succeed often
enough that it is well worth the effort.  You can succeed sometimes,
too!

If there are some situations where you don't dare simply say No, there
are other cases where you can carry that off.  Rather than giving up
because you might fail, try and you might succeed.  It might not
require as much "privilege" as some claim.

There are other approaches, too.  For instance, if MIT imposes
requirements to run nonfree Javascript code, several affected people
could get together and meet with whoever is in charge, if necessary
President Reif, to get the system changed.

Another method is by developing a front-end for Firefox which replaces
the nonfree Javascript code.  I and the FSF recruit people to do this
kind of work.  You can, too.  We can do it together.  No "privilege"
is needed to do this.

Do you have a rule that the projects developed at the hackfest must be
released as free software?  I think that is called for.  Implicitly,
the idea of a hackfest is that people join in other people's projects.
Why should a project that won't share with the community be offered
the community's support in recruiting developers?

On Jan 29 and Feb 9, MIT will hold consultations on the future of
libraries.  Bad possible futures spring to mind: they could make it
even harder to get information without running nonfree software, they
could move further towards replacing printed books with DRM-restricted
ebooks.  I will be out of town on those dates and won't be able to
attend to raise these issues.

Is there anyone here who would like to go there and argue against
those bad futures?  Write to me if you want to.

Just the contrary.  Making a program nonfree is restrictive: it
restricts the _users_ of the program.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html
for why it is wrong to make a program nonfree.

  > Not the license itself, but the
  > fact it is mandatory to hold a certain license.

There seems to be a misunderstanding here.  I did not suggest
requiring a certain (specific) license, only that the program
carry some free software license.

See http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html for a list of known
free software licenses.

To reduce problems of license incompatibility, it would be good to
insist on using a license that is compatible with GPL version 3 and
later.  Most of the widely used free licenses satisfy that criterion.

  >  Doesn't this limit the
  > freedom of the developers?

Imposing their control over users through nonfree software is 
an exercise of power, not freedom.

The hackathon represents a community.  Developers have the legal right
to make programs proprietary, but why offer them the support of the
community for developing a program that they will not share with the
community?  Let them do it on their own!

Thus, I urge on all hackathons to adopt the rule that code must
have clear license notices stating licensing that is compatible
with GPL-v3-or-later.

Dear MIT Faculty and  Staff,

 

As you may recall, last fall Provost Marty Schmidt asked me to convene an Ad
Hoc Task Force on the Future of Libraries, which has been charged with
examining "how the MIT Libraries ought to evolve to best advance the
creation, dissemination, and preservation of knowledge; and to serve as a
leader in the reinvention of research libraries."  In pursuing this task, it
is essential that the Task Force collect broad input from the MIT community,
including faculty, staff and students.  

 

To that end, I would like to invite you to attend one of the two open forums
that we have scheduled specifically for a combination of faculty and staff
(separate forums are being arranged for students, and for library staff) and
to share your ideas for what a bold new vision for MIT Libraries ought to
include.

 

Friday, January 29 at Noon - 1:00 PM, Location: 32-144   

Important note: Lunch will be provided at this meeting, so please RSVP to

No need to RSVP for this session.

 

Key members of the Task Force and I will attend each of these meetings, and
we are eager to hear your thoughts and engage in open discussion about the
future of our Libraries.

  > I don?t think so. People have a right to do what they want with

Legally, they do -- ethically, I don't think so.  But the issue I
raised is neither of those, because we're not talking about what
they do on their own.

People are running a hackathon: a community activity which invites,
encourages and aids people to develop certain software; what sort of
projects ought to be promoted in this way?  It is an MIT activity,
carried out in MIT's name.  What sort of projects should MIT choose
to encourage and aid?

One can hardly argue that MIT or the hacker community should choose to
encourage and aid any software project that isn't illegal.

I propose that hackathons should be limited to projects that
contribute their code to the community in a good way: under a free
software license.

I don't know anything about the Pumatrac API, so I don't know whether
its use is a bad thing.  Would someone like to investigate the facts
about it?

It is bad for a program to _depend on_ (other) nonfree software, but
even worse for the program to _be_ nonfree software.

When a free program depends on a nonfree program, we say it is "free
but trapped" (see http://gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html).  It is
possible to untrap these free programs, with work.  All free programs
written in Java were let loose when we developed a free Java
implementation.

We've gone through this before: that freedom requires so much sacrifice
that most people don't consider it a real option.

And it's getting worse.  For thousands of Americans, perhaps millions,
refusing to use nonfree software implies punishment by the state.
They will be suspended from school, then punished for truancy.

I don't think developers have an ethical obligation to release
software; but if they do release it, they should not do so in a way
that imposes their power on the users.

A seminar announcement made some rather bizarre claims.

Would someone like to go to that event and point out that we can still
do any and all of these things without using a data system?  And, for
privacy's sake, we ought to avoid the data system, except for flights
since they will insist on knowing who we are?

And that perhaps friends don't always want to tell friends where
they are?

The reason I am concerned with this is that it sounds like a push
to convince us to drop our resistance to technology that would deny
us privacy which, in most cases, we can still defend.

There seems to be some sort of misunderstanding.  I always pay cash
for groceries -- I have never needed to "go through a data system" to
do this.

  > I'm sure

I am sure they do, but that is changing the subject.  The issue is not
whether the store uses a "data system".  It is whether the _customer_ is
obliged to "go through" one to buy.

I'm be sorry for them for running nonfree software, but that has no
direct effect on a customer like me who buys from that store.

Here, again, is the claim that the speaker made:

    >> Already today we need to go through a data system in order to do
    >> several basic tasks, e.g., to pay at the grocery store, to book a
    >> flight, to find out where our friends are and even to get coffee.

You're changing the subject in the same way as Wollman.
(By the way, I don't see anything wrong with that inventory control.)

I am skeptical of this claim.  How would they separate what I buy from
what all the other unidentified customers buy?  Do they do
photographic recognition of every repeat customer?  My purchases do
not follow a weekly routine, either; there is nothing that I buy on
every visit.

However, they certainly collect data about customers that they can
identify.  That's why I posted about this in the first place: because
that practice is one we can respond to in various ways.

The talk announcement claims (almost explicitly) that surveillance is
impossible to resist and that we are all resigned to it.  That is a
false claim and it encourages people to give in.

But that is not the only possible attitude.  We can resist
surveillance individually, and we can campaign for laws against it.

You're changing the subject again.
Whether the store uses a data system is not the question.

This should be regulated by law, but that is a separate issue.  It
might be worth a separate discussion.  See

It could suspect, this way, that someone has a dog and an infant,
that's true.  But it can't be sure that person lives in Cambridgeport.
That is just a guess.

Also, this assumes you buy everything in one store.  I shop in varios
stores and I don't buy everything together or in one place.

I also don't have a repeating weekly pattern.  This is not intentional
surveillance resistance, just what's natural for me.

I am safe from that kind of tracking because I don't carry Stalin's
Dream with me.

These methods work for some kinds of people, to some extent.
Rather than get distracted arguing about how much, let's look at
the issue they raise.  Should stores track people this way?
If not, should we stop them?

Even if surveillance goes both ways, those with power will be more
able to use their surveillance to increase their power.  I posted an
argument to this effect in ieet.org and Brin was unable to effectively

My proposals for regulation are in
http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.
I reject surveillance systems personally for several reasons:

1. To set an example.
2. To refute accusations that I am lazy and don't bother
   to protect myself.
3. To draw attention to the wrong.
4. (In some cases) To refuse to be a reason why someone
   else exposes perself to surveillance.

We were talking about what stores do to track people's purchases.

XKeyscore is operated by the NSA, and snoops on internet and phone
communications using access imposed by the state.  Although indeed
both do surveillance, they are very different issues.

They are so different that I find this argument unconvincing.
However, even though XKeyscore is a different issue, I am interested
in what it does to identify individuals.  I'd like to see under what
conditions it can do so.  Can you point us at an article about this?

We can win a lot more, with a lot less sacrifices, if we organize and
campaign for regulations to limit data collection.  Most stores would
not collect or retain data in ways prohiited by law.

How about telling your state representative that you want laws to
limit those practices?  (And that getting customers' "consent" in some
perfunctory way should not be enough to allow it.)

How about telling your state representative that you want laws to
limit license plate cameras so that they can only recognize invalid
plates or plates that are specifically sought by court order?

How about telling your state representative that you want laws so tha
security cameras cannot be connected to any network if they are
looking at a public place?  (For the difference between a security
camera and a surveillance camera, see
http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.)

I did this already.  You can. too.

I can't see how any of this applies to the case of Target, and you

The first question that this group needs to take up is how to define
"security" -- from whose point of view?  Is it the security of the car
manufacturer, or the security of the car owner, or of the people in
the car?

For instance, suppose the car has a camera which is used to recognize
people in the car by their faces and transmit their personal identity
information to a site chosen by the manufacturer.  If "security" is
defined from the manufacturer's perspective, this does not violate
security.  But if "security" is defined from the passenger's
perspective, it a gross violation.

I propose that the proper meaning of security
is from the perspective of the driver and the passengers
against the manufacturer and all others.

I understand your criticism of PDF, but I have no idea what sort
of thing you have in mind instead.  PDF is a file format;
these files can be transmitted in all sorts of ways.

What does it mean to replace that with "Web"?  What would that
replacemen be?

I can imagine lots of unjust possibilities.  It could be SaaSS (see
https://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html).
It could require running nonfree Javascript code.  It could require
everyone to make an accout.

Even imposing the need to communicate directly with some specific web
site, though I wouldn't call it "unjust", would be a pain in the neck
if it means we can't transfer files by scp or USB sticks.  There are
many web sites I can't access because they block Tor.  For instance,
irs.gov.  When they distribute PDF files, people can download them and
give them to me.

Some alternatives could be good.  These would continue to be based on
distributing files, perhaps in some better or simpler file format.

  > To Richard's point, it also makes it harder to
  > find fully open-source implementations.

My point was about free software, not about open source.
Most open source programs are free, but there are a few exceptions.
Also, free software and open source are totally different ideas.
See https://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html.

However, that was only a secondary point.  PDF was not originally
supported by free software, but we managed to get some.  Likewise,
HTML was not originally supported by free software, but we managed to
get some.

My main point is that an article must be a file -- so that you can use
it offline, and you can send someone else a copy.

To require access to some web site in order to read an article is
asking for hassles.  It could screw you because you don't have access
to the internet.  It could screw you because the site requires login,
or demands that you agree to unjust terms of service.  It could screw
you with DRM endorsed by the W3C.

The format of the file contents is a less important qestion.  I don't
think representing text as a self-contained file of HTML is worse, a
priori, than a self-contained PDF file.

However, what if the the article contains images?  In that case,
normal HTML practice is to put them in separate files.  Is it even
possible to include all the images in an HTML file?  I don't know, but
it doesn't seem to be done.  If inconvenience in doing that leads to
making the article consist of multiple files, you're into the big
problems.

I suppose it would be possible to develop a single-file web page
format that includes images, and it could be better for documents than
PDF.

However, if the desire to go beyond showing some fixed document
dominates the format's design, it is likely to be much worse for
documents than PDF.

Will your device driver be released as free software?
If so, I can ask free software supporters in Japan to help.




    I don't want to get into it, but this sounds like a real, recurring 
    problem, and a danger to the users of the machine shop.  Do we need to 
    maybe put prox card readers on the doors?  On the machines?

Let's not propose the most drastic option first.  If the shop needs to
be locked, it could be locked with ordinary keys as it was in Tech Sq.
It doesn't even need to be a super-secure lock, not for this kind of
problem.  A cheap lock whose keys are cheap would do fine, together
with a system where all lab members who take shop classes and agree to
take responsibility are given keys.




    I don't see how safety training can help with lack of social conscience 
    which usually compels people to clean up after themselves, and restore 
    order.  These two are quite different, and no amount of safety training 
    can help change a slob.

People's behavior patterns are not innate and unchangeable.  Humans
are social beings and very much influenced by social surroundings.
Establishing a relationship between a shop user and the shop
management can alter the user's conduct.  Asking the user to make a
commitment will influence many people who otherwise would have acted
thoughtlessly.




      As the number of hardware hackers in the 
    lab declined, this tradition vanished, and now with the size of CSAIL, 
    there isn't enough manpower (Ronpower?) to educate all the newbies.

The practical lack of education is the crucial problem; shop access is
secondary.  Control over access cannot substitute for training the
shop's intended users.

In principle, shop users are supposed to get training; but it appears
that this is being carried out insufficiently in practice.  If users
are not properly trained, they could damage the machinery or injure
themselves.  And even when that doesn't happen, they may be unable to
build the things they are trying to build.


The education problem needs to be solved in any case.  Doing that will
naturally reduce the extent of the problem of misuse--so that what
remains of that problem will be much easier to address.  It makes no
sense to plan solutions for the misuse problem now, on the assumption
that the education problem is ignored.  We should solve the education
problem first, then see what remains to be done.




    Because we should be setting examples for privacy protection here at the 
    lab, I'd expect a rigorous policy which maintains video footage only 
    through the next work day (barring an incident).

With this kind of policy, monitoring with video is not a bad thing.
This is much better than the way the pox locks' data is handled.




    Ron will be the end-user of whatever happens to the shop.  While I see the 
    advantages of video, I wonder how Ron will figure out who is on the video 
    or where to find them, or if he even has time in his busy day to view the 
    many hours of video involved.

I presume he would look at the video when he finds a mess in the shop.
Otherwise no one will look at it.

    In the context of providing access to the world of computing for those
    who would otherwise be isolated, I would submit that even
    [plug deleted] products _increase_ effective freedom for the user.

It might enable some people to do some things, but don't confuse
enablement with freedom.  (Disregard for this difference is commonly
cited in anti-freedom arguments.)

    For a period of a few years, I would not have been able to use Free
    Software products if it were not for [plug deleted].

The word "product", as well as the substance of the statement, takes
convenience as the goal.  Regarding certain free programs as sources
of convenience, it concludes that a nonfree program is good if it
enables you to take advantage of them.

Different conclusions follow from taking freedom as the goal.  The
free programs don't trample freedom, but the nonfree program does.
So if you use them both, your freedom gets trampled by the latter.

If we hope to have a free program to take dictation some day,
we must not treat the nonfree ones as acceptable.

     On the third hand, it has been argued that the  
    behaviors that contributed to the crisis were already legal before  
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley.

The US has been deregulating banks continually for 20 years if not
more.  That law was one step in the process.  It adds up to change in
the regulatory climate, which led banksters to think they could get
away with anything if they made it complex enough not to be glaringly
obvious.

Even those like me, who don't recall the details, can conclude
that this long-term deregulation made the crisis possible.

    For  
    example, some people thought that US banks losing out to foreign  
    competition was a serious threat.

People naturally disagree, but not all disagreement is innocent --
especially when business is involved.

The reason for deregulation of banks was pressure from the banks,
and I suspect this concern was part of it.

When businesses want a policy or law change, they often invent some
false danger, or exaggerate a minor real problem, to claim some
disaster will happen if they don't get it.

This concern has the air of such a campaign.  Perhaps some of those
people were asked by banks to say they were worried that US banks were
too small.  Perhaps they were rewarded by those banks for doing so.
It need not be so crass as a direct quid-pro-quo.  Corporate media
pump up the "concern", probably requested to do so.  Then politicians,
probably convinced by campaign contributions, can cite this "concern"
as the reason why they deregulate.

    This topic comes up a lot, but realistically, if you pay cash for your

    even know about you, or in particular about your identity?

If you pay cash, they don't know anything about you unless at some
point they stop you and check your card.  But then they'd know your

I'm supposed to return to Cambridge on Friday,
and leave again on Sunday for a trip lasting thru March 22.
My suitcase is broken, and can't be fixed during that
brief period in Cambridge.  Can anyone lend me a suitcase
to take on the coming trip?

This way I won't have to buy another suitcase just for this trip.

Ideally the suitcase should have wheels, but I could use one without
wheels if that's all I can find.

It is a shame that they ask people to sign up on eventbrite.
That means that (1) attendees have to use proprietary software
and (2) they are putting all the attendees data in a company's
data base.

If the goal is "effective altruism", this treatment of the audience,
denying each person's freedom and privacy, needs to be counted on the

By setting up the event this way, you're giving a company the list of
participants.  That disrespects the privacy of the MIT community.

I tried to look at the site's privacy policy, but I couldn't access
it.  That link took me to lanyon.com/privacy-policy.shtml, and when I
clicked on English I got a page with a large empty box.  Apparently
the site makes you run nonfree Javascript software even to see the
privacy policy.

(I expect that the privacy policy provides no real privacy, because
that's standard practice, but I wanted to check it first before
criticizing it.)

Since I don't actually want to attend the event, I was unable to
determine whether registration would actually work, since I won't run
the site's nonfree Javascript code.  Can anyone tell?

On the contrary, we have made great strides in preserving the original
meaning of "hack" and "hackers".  Lots of people know of "hacklabs".
There are semi-popular books about "hacking" some area of activity,
and they do not mean breaking any sort of security.

Now all we need is to advance use of some other term for
security-breakers.

It is nosy to ask people to register for a talk with their personal
data.  To ask them to do so with Eventbrite is even worse, since that
hands their personal information to a company, and probably to the FBI
as well.

In addition, Eventbrite makes people run nonfree software to register.
That infringes their freedom.

    I am in the middle of installing a win7 wm (using vmware fusion) on my new
    (first) mac.

It's not too late to look at windows7sins.org and change your mind.




      The client is open-source (but not
    Free-as-in-RMS), but the server is not.

I am not the only person here who appreciates software freedom.  I
think you have just dismissed all the others as nobody.  But more
important is the substantive issue.

Programs which are open source but not free do exist, but they are
rarely encountered.  Misunderstandings about the two definitions are
much more common.  Could you state the license that client program
released under?  Then we could see if it really is free (and if it
really is open source).

The concept of free software is defined for programs; it is not
applicable to a server (a machine you contact over the net) or a
service (what that machine does for you).  So I am not sure what it
would mean to say that the server is not free in the sense of free
software.  What meaning did you have in mind?




    Last time I checked, Facebook's privacy policy said they'd hand over
    details based ona subpoena, a request from law enforcmen or "other
    similar requests" leading it wide open for them to do exactly that
    already.

The issue here is not about Facebook's policy.  Facebook was just
an example.

The issue is about a law that would eliminate all choice about the
matter -- not just for Facebook but for any online service.

The status quo gives Big Brother too much power to demand information
about people.  CISPA would make this even worse.

I won't be in town for the talk on April 23 about static analysis of
large C programs, so I can only see the abstract.  The abstract leaves
an open question: is this program free software or not?  If so, it is
a real contribution.  If not, it is just a tease.

If I were in town on April 23, I'd go to the talk, and ask the speaker
whether the program will be released as free software.  If he wasn't
sure what that means, I'd explain that in Korean it's "jayu" (which
means free as in freedom, libre), and it means that users get the source
code and are free to change and redistribute it.

If he said it is free, I would express appreciation for his decision
to contribution to human knowledge.

If he said it wasn't free, I would urge him to make it free so that
his work can be worthy of admiration -- because if he doesn't
contribute to our community, there is nothing for us to admire.

I won't be there to say any of these things, so I hope others will say
them for me.

    Sony initially experimented with a somewhat more open architecture with

I think the system you mean cannot be Linux.  Linux is a kernel, and

    No, our application is not itself open source.

In that case, it surely is not free software either.  (There are a few
special cases where a program can be open source and not free,
see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html,
but all free programs would in principle qualify as open source.)

GNU Health is free software and already handles electronic medical

    Amazon does indeed have excellent usability and I applaud them for
    it in the same way I applaud any well-designed user experience.

I disagree with that way of looking at the situation.  Doing
engineering well does not mean that the activity is admirable.

    With your emphasis on personal freedom and responsibility, don't
    you think that the guilt for overspending lies entirely with the
    user

The user is partly responsible, because the user could have had and
exercised more self control.  However, Amazon is also responsible, if
Amazon intentionally leads people into buying more than they intended
to.  Amazon is not alone in this: other stores adopt strategems to
lead people into buying more than they intended to.  They too are
responsible for that conduct.

People do not have unlimited self-control, and we should not approach
social issues as if we expected they should.  Thus, systematically
manipulating people can deserve criticism even if nobody is literally
forced to go along.  This can be a reason to decide not to buy from a
store.  Even if you don't blame the store for it, you might still
consider it a reason to avoid that store.

Nonetheless, I agree that this is not as nasty as the other Amazon
conduct listed in the page.

    I read your list of concerns with Amazon and I think most were
    reasonable, but the final point you made, quoted below, severely
    undermined the credibility of all former statements, at least for
    me.

My credibility is not even relevant here.

If I had said, "Amazon is bad, take my word for it," then you would
have had to judge how much credence to put in my conclusion.  Instead,
stallman.org/amazon.html cites facts with references, and puts them
together with principles you can judge for yourself.  It does not ask
you to take my word for anything.

    The idea is that when you are trying to change or correct someone's point
    of view, if the evidence you provide is stronger than it needs to do and
    the literal meaning of the evidence is not self explanatory (as is the case
    of your final point) -- regardless of how true that evidence may be --,
    then they stop believing you.

I don't entirely understand that paragraph -- I am not sure how "is
stronger than it needs to do" (or "to be") relates to the text in my
page.  Can you explain?

This is a totally different issue from the one that someone else
brought up.  He claims that systematically manipulating the public
their detriment cannot be blameworthy.  I think that's wrong in
general, but I don't want to spend time arguing about that tangent.

You're raising an issue of effective rhetoric, and maybe you're right.
If you show me how that abstract description applies to this concrete
case, maybe I could see how to take advantage of it.

    Yes, storefronts are responsible for their own actions but, as a
    business, their business is to stay in business (and thrive); is
    not selling more goods their biological imperative,

Humans have a biological imperative to eat.  They don't have an
imperative to increase profits or to "sell more goods".  They might
have a natural tendency to desire to do so, but a tendency to desire
is not an imperative.

							the existence
    of which prospective customers would be well-advised to understand
    before dealing with them?

I already agreed, in my previous message, that customers are
responsible if they spend too much.  However, the people running the
business are also responsible.  "If you were smarter you would have
resisted the temptation we offered you," is not a valid universal
excuse for whatever a business does.

    Perhaps I am assuming too much about what your assignment of
    responsibility entails for Amazon as a company, though. Assuming
    you had sufficient influence as to exert your will, would you
    proscribe the existence of such a fluid shopping experience?

All I'd thought of doing was suggesting to people that they might want
to avoid such a store.

Now that you've raised the issue, it seems to me that laws requiring
stores to ask for confirmation -- "Do you really mean to spend $XYZ"
-- just to make shopping less "fluid" might be a good idea.  However,
that is not a conclusion; I don't have any position on the question.


I saw this point in a web page which, for a reason I don't recall, I
did not want to link to.  Since it is secondary, and since it seems to
work against the goal, I deleted it.

    It seems it would be healthier and of similar efficiency to have a few
    arterial highways that contain cars, which park centrally at hubs (say
    5-10 min walk to the destination). Most of the city then would be
    reserved for walking and bicycling only.

I hope there will be buses a well.  Not all of us can ride a bicycle,
and walking around in a modern city can take a long time.

     I've always been curious
    about walking-only cities such as Venice for this reason. 

Venice is much smaller than Boston, but it is not walking-only.  It
has omnibuses and taxis on the water.

Aaron Swartz, founder of Demand Progress, killed himself.

http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/01/12

The article says he had a problem with depression, but apparently not
to the point of blinding him to reality.  Swartz faced the threat of
years in prison for what must have been a scheme to liberate scholarly
articles restricted by JSTOR.  A US prosecutor insisted on prosecuting
him even though JSTOR forgave him.  Surely Obama had told prosecutors
to make an example on behalf of the copyright industry whenever they
found an opportunity.

People who knew Aaron must feel personal grief.  What does this mean
for us who did not know him personally?  As a campaigner for freedom,
he would surely have wanted us to make his death serve his life's
work.

Would anyone like to help organize a rally outside the office of the
prosecutor?

The prosecutor got this opportunity partly thanks to MIT's reaction to
Swartz's activities.  MIT's network policies, not designed with this
kind of situation in mind, had that effect.

Can we launch the redesign of this policy, to make sure that in the
future MIT will have the chance to decide whether to cause someone to
be prosecuted?

Thanks for the suggestion to write to Lessig; I will do that.  In the
mean time, I'd like to hear from anyone interested in helping to plan
a rally, or plan efforts to change MIT's policies for response to
network incursions.

I think your concern for the feelings of the prosecutors is misplaced.
I hope that they are questioning the rightness of their actions, but
there is more at stake here than their feelings.  They are public
officials, and the issue concerns their conduct as officials.  What
they did went far beyond public criticism.  If they feel ashamed and
public criticism stings, they should resign and apologize.  I would
shake their hand if they did that.

Although they carried out this attack, it was probably under orders.
Thus, the principal target of the protest should be higher-ups.

Should we take advantage of Aaron's death to fight for freedom to
share?  If he could see us, I think he would tear his hair out in
frustration if we fail to.

    But: PACER allows any individual to download a small number of documents 
    for free.  So could we crowdsource opening all of PACER? Write an 
    extension that automatically downloads and RECAPs a few random 
    documents, then encourage every internet user to install the extention?  

That action would be positive, but it would be aiming too low.  I
think we should focus on the bigger wrong: the copyright industry.

Firstly, because it IS bigger -- in this area, it is the main enemy,
and PACER is secondary.  Secondly, because that's the enemy that set
up the system of injustice-in-depth that drove Swartz to death.

It is no coincidence that the two reasons go together.  The copyright
industry set up its system of power projection, which our president
vigorously supported by appointing ex-RIAA staff to the Justice
Department, because it was big enough and powerful enough to do so.

And thirdly, because taking the copyright industry down a peg can't be
done with a clever hack like RECAP.  It requires political organizing
and persistence -- which is exactly what Aaron Swartz did when he
founded Demand Progress.

It is misguided to look for "easy" ways to commemorate Swartz that
would focus on tangential problems and avoid tackling the central wrong.

Aiming to liberate only the public domain (i.e., many decades old)
papers in JSTOR is another way of ducking the main issue, since it
would not challenge the unjust premise of JSTOR.

Likewise, focusing mainly on changing MIT's policies for responding to
intrusions would be ducking the main issue.  We should make sure these
policies are changed, but we should not do _only_ that.

As for a posthumous pardon, I am not sure whether a formal pardon is
necessary (or possible) for someone who was never convicted.  If it
is, then Swartz deserves it.  But making that the focus would be going
astray: that would not change the injustice that crushed him for
trying to challenge it.  I am sure he would be the first to say we
should not let sentiment for him distract us from carrying on his
fight, which is our fight.

The best way to honor his name is to win for freedom as he sought to.

    One easy thing we could do is to refuse to publish in any journal that 
    does not provide free access to all.  I have personally made it a policy 
    to never again submit a paper to a journal that is not Open Access.

There is also a campaign to refuse to review papers for the journals that
don't do free publication.

(The term "open access" is misleading since it focuses on the
shallower issue of access to the original publication site, while
failing to mention the deeper issue of what people are allowed to do
with the paper.  I will have an article posted about this by tomorrow
I hope.)

Personal rejection of those journals is a good thing, but doing it
piecemeal individually is not strong pressure.  We should call on MIT
to make its existing policy in favor of free publication firm and
mandatory -- no exceptions allowed.

       Surely the D.A. was attempting to force
    Aaron to plead
    guilty on a lesser charge by threatening extreme punishment.

This suggests that Swartz decided he would rather die than accept the
dishonor of granting validity to an illegitimate accusation.

      Unfortunately, all I seem to be able to do when I
    refuse to review for such venues is discredit myself instead of "changing
    hearts and minds".

I don't think that is really true, even if it looks that way.
Maybe you are hoping for too much result from your own refusal.

The idea of this sort of campaign is that you simply tell them, "I
won't review for a journal with restrictive publication policies."
You don't discuss it further unless they ask you to.  That makes it
very little work to uphold the campaign, and they are not likely
to focus on you personally enough to have an opinion about you.

Of course, one such refusal is not likely to persuade a journal to
change policies.  The idea is that many people refuse and the point
sinks in.  So do it the quick and easy way, and you'll be
contributing your share and paying no penalty.

If you want to do more for the cause, you can encourage others to
join you in the refusal.

    That's an awful, abusive situation that does occur.  And I believe that, 
    when we see what looks like that situation -- in which someone was 
    denied a just process -- that we don't, ironically, immediately turn 
    around and punish someone else without a just process.

You seem to be arguing that we should never call for the removal of a
public official without the precautions that the state must take in a
trial.  

That is absurd, because (1) we can't take those precautions and (2) we
are not obligated to do so.

We can't do it because we have neither the money nor the power to run
an investigation and make people testify.

We are not obligated to do it because we are not proposing to imprison
someone or take away someone's legal rights.  Officials work for us!

We must not accept impossible conditions on the right to petition for
the removal of an appointed official.

I signed the petition, and I hope others will too.

According to the lawyer I spoke with, US Attorneys have a lot of
autonomy.  I suspect that she was influenced by the prevailing climate
of demonization of sharing as "piracy", which makes the authors of
that climate co-responsible; but they would not have ordered her
specifically to do any of this, so they do not provide her with an
excuse to claim she was not responsible.

    Then, rather than call for the removal of a particular person, why not 
    call for an investigation of what happened?

An investigation could be very useful -- for instance, to determine
what role MIT played in this series of events.

However, the reason to remove Ortiz does not depend on
details that an investigation might discover.  The reason is that
she threw the book at someone who had done no real harm to anyone.

To be sure, they found excuses to pretend he did.  Quibbling about
those excuses is a side issue; the wrong was deciding to use them.

    Before proceeding, note that this response is unambiguously illegal.  

I have not yet seen what they are doing, but you might be.  If so,
that could make the action dangerous.  I don't plan to participate,
for that reason.

However, that's a separate question from the ethics of the matter.
Until I see what they say, I can't have a judgment; however, breaking
an unjust law in order to defeat a predatory empire is often good.

If the campaign limits itself to the articles that are in the public
domain, it addresses only a tiny fraction of the problem.  If it
succeeds at that, it is only the first skirmish.

    *Basics of Copyright and Software Intellectual Property*

Copyright as it affects software is an important issue.
However, referring to it as "intellectual property" spreads
confusion.  The announcement of this talk encourages people
to formulate their thoughts in a confused framework.
With that starting point, it would be difficult for the talk
to give people a clear undertanding even if it tries.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html for an explanation
of why the term "intellectual property" interferes with clear
thinking of copyright, and also with clear thinking about the
5 or 10 other disparate and unrelated laws to which that term
is sometimes applied.

Would anyone like to print copies of that page to distribute
at that talk as a handout?

    I've written to my senators and congressman, which seems to me
    like an approach more likely to work than signing whitehouse
    petitions.

That question seems to presume that you must choose one or the other.
However, it is possib;e to do both.  Signing the petition is so easy
that it's worth while even if the chance of success is tiny.

Besides which, one kind of success is virtually certain: it shows that
a considerable body of the public condemns the prosecution of Swartz.
Any additional success is a bonus.

    1) Should publicly funded work be freely available
    My answer: Yes in principle but I don't see how to fund the needed expenses

The solution for this is already clear, since it is already in use and
functioning.  Nonfree journals keep going based on the power that
their publishers have already built up.  (ISTR someone spoke here
about feeling he could not dare refuse to publish in SIGGRAPH.)

MIT could knock put an end to nonfree journals by ceasing to allow
exceptions to its "open access" policy.

    3) Did the D.A.'s office behave properly?
    My answer. They tried to compel a guilty plea by threatening excessive
    punishment.
    This is immoral but also standard.  They will never never admit they
    behaved badly as
    this would invalidate much of our judicial process.

I agree with you, but we don't need to obtain their assent or
agreement before we condemn them and call for their removal.

    Or, attacking from the other end,  when recruiting to ask for a CV which 
    lists open articles in a separate earlier section from non-open articles,
    so those reviewing an application can give higher weight to them.

This is a good idea (but let's not use the weak word "open" to
describe it, because the deepest issue is the license they are
published with).

MIT should make this a standard policy.

However, the existing "open access" policy is weak because it allows
exceptions -- I think we need to change that.

Ortiz's statement is a half truth.  It tries to give the impression
that she was obligated to prosecute Swartz, but that was not so.
She could have decided the case was not worth prosecuting.
That decision was up to her.

I think it is also disingenuous on the subject of the sentence.  If
Swartz had gone to trial and been convicted, the judge would have
decided the sentence at his discretion.  (Does any of these crimes
have a mandatory minimum sentence?)  However, the maximum penaltes for
those accusations were decades long.  When she says "six months", she
is talking about a possible plea bargain.  Correct me if I am
mistaken, but if judges accept a plea bargain, I think they rarely if
ever reduce the sentence.

    I'm curious, should we hate the player or the game?

Both.  It is a mistake to suppose we must excuse one or the other.

It is right to point out that we should not ignore what's wrong with
the system.  However, recognizing that an injustice is systemic does
not mean we should excuse the people who carry it out on any one
occasion.

"I was just doing my job" is not an ethical excuse for doing wrong.
The people who choose to do these jobs -- and who choose to push
harder and thus increase the extent to which their jobs involve doing
wrong -- try to use this argument to shift all blame away from
themselves.  We must not fall for it.

    Put another way: wouldn't it be better to make a push for real change in
    the system rather than a push for a fairly symbolic gesture?

The campaign to fire Ortiz calls for an action that would be no mere
gesture.  It would punish someone who chose to do wrong.

However, it can do more than that.  Condemnation and punishment of a
specific act of overprosecution can fuel the campaign to change the
system of overprosecution.

Even without formal reform, this campaign directly affects the system
of overprosecution.  Each time that is done, a prosecutor has chosen
to do it.  Seeing that it can blow back will affect their choices.
That is not a full solution, but it is something.

This action (the petition to fire Ortiz) is justified.  It pushes the
system away from wrong, and strengthens the campaign for further
change.  Thus, it is good on every count.

However, it would be a mistake to do _only_ this.  You're right in
arguing that the case of Ortiz should not distract us from what's
wrong with the system.

    It's important to remember that free (as in speech) journals are not 
    free (as in beer) to operate.  Someone has to pay for the 
    hosting/distribution/archiving.

Yes.  And it's already being done.  MIT will have to pay for (and
charge research sponsors for) part of scientific publishing.  It can
do this through subscriptions and it can do this through publication
fees.

    For a paper I'm publishing at the royal society, they've told me they'll 
    be happy to make the article open, so long as I pay the necessary 
    (roughly $1000) cost of maintaining that article 

This journal is trying a swindle.  It wants to charge some authors a
fee  for "open" publication (I don't know whether it uses a free
license) and continue charging MIT for a subscription for the sake of
the rest of the articles.  The fee seems rather high, too.

    I proposed to Richard privately that some sub-communities such as
    graphics have journals such as SIGGRAPH that have somewhat closed
    policies but still allow authors to self publish online. Because of
    this, I believe it may be currently politically infeasible to force
    all researchers  to not publish in the top journals of their field and
    insist on only free/open publications.

MIT can and should impose this requirement.  SIGGRAPH cannot maintain
its restrictive policies if a few prestigious universities decide to
challenge them head-on.

    To be explicit: this sounds like exactly the type of mentality that we're
    lambasting;

There are similarities and differences.  To say "exactly" is to deny
the differences.

One difference is that Ortiz has an office with special power, whereas
Swartz did not.  Another difference is that Ortiz really hurt someone,
whereas Swartz did not.

Another difference is that we are not talking about putting Ortiz in
prison, only removing her from the office with special power.

    * Their objective is to make as much content as possible available to as 
    many people as possible.  But they are constrained by what the 
    commercial publishers (who hold the copyrights) allow them to do.

This the standard excuse offered by the collaborators that work for
and maintain an unjust regime.  They say they are trying to be as kind
and gentle to us as possible, given of course that they must enforce
the regime's orders.

That little bit of lenience doesn't justify propping up that regime
as JSTOR does.

    * In particular, they have a class of "Early Journal Content" (all 
    articles published prior to 1923) which they *know* is in the public 
    domain.

I will grant that JSTOR is not doing anything wrong as regards these
articles.  They must be invaluable for the study of the history of
science.

Where JSTOR does wrong is with the vast majority of its articles,
those published since 1923.  If it has articles about the AI field,
they must be part of that majority.

We have a choice of possible reactions to JSTOR.  We can either thank
JSTOR for the small concession it has given us and forgive about the
larger continuing wrong.  Or we can fight to put an end to that wrong.

      For example, access 
    to all of JSTOR is free in much of Africa.

Is locking up science in most of the world to be excused because they
make a partial exception for a few?  I don't think so.

    * I get the sense that they would welcome creative solutions, but that 
    these would have to be true solutions that satisfy publishers,

"A true solution" and "satisfying the publishers" are incompatible
goals, because the publishers want to obstruct science and they will
only be satisfied if they succeed.

In the name of science, we must take away their power and defeat them
-- and if that makes them unsatisfied, so be it.  This is what Aaron
Swartz campaigned for.

Let us not distort his memory by asking in his name for the minor
concessions that publishers might willingly grant.

This is directly pertinent to whether JSTOR deserves our
admiration and respect.


## Aaron's Army

(Text of Remarks by Carl Malamud at Memorial for Aaron Swartz at the
Internet Archive on January 24, 2013)

Do not think for a moment that Aaron's work on JSTOR was the random
act of a lone hacker, some kind of crazy, spur-of-the-moment bulk
download.

JSTOR had long come in for withering criticism from the net. Larry
Lessig called JSTOR a moral outrage in a talk and I suppose I have to
confess he was quoting me. We weren't the only ones fanning those
flames.

Sequestering knowledge behind pay walls--making scientific journals
only available to a few kids fortunate enough to be at fancy
universities and charging $20 an article for the remaining 99% of
us--was a festering wound. It offended many people.

It embarrassed many who wrote those articles that their work had
become somebody's profit margin, a members-only country club of
knowledge.

Many of us helped fan those flames. Many of us feel guilty today for
fanning those flames.

But JSTOR was just one of many battles. They tried to paint Aaron as
some kind of lone-wolf hacker, a young terrorist who went on a crazy
IP killing spree that caused $92 million in damages.

Aaron wasn't a lone wolf, he was part of an army, and I had the honor
of serving with him for a decade. You have heard many things about his
remarkable life, but I want to focus tonight on just one.

Aaron was part of an army of citizens that believes democracy only
works when the citizenry are informed, when we know about our
rights--and our obligations. An army that believes we must make
justice and knowledge available to all--not just the well born or
those that have grabbed the reigns of power--so that we may govern
ourselves more wisely.

He was part of an army of citizens that rejects kings and generals and
believes in rough consensus and running code.

We worked together on a dozen government databases. When we worked on
something, the decisions weren't rash. Our work often took months,
sometimes years, sometimes a decade, and Aaron Swartz did not get his
proper serving of decades.

We looked at and poked at the U.S. Copyright database for a long time,
a system so old it was still running WAIS. The government had--believe
it or not--asserted copyright on the copyright database. How you
copyright a database that is specifically called out in the
U.S. Constitution is beyond me, but we knew we were playing with fire
by violating their terms of use, so we were careful.

We grabbed that data and it was used to feed the Open Library here at
the Internet Archive and it was used to feed Google Books. And, we got
a letter from the Copyright Office waiving copyright on that copyright
database. But before we did that, we had to talk to many lawyers and
worry about the government hauling us in for malicious premeditated
bulk downloading.

These were not random acts of aggression. We worked on databases to
make them better, to make our democracy work better, to help our
government.  We were not criminals.

When we brought in 20 million pages of U.S. District Court documents
from behind their 8 cent-per-page PACER pay wall, we found these
public filings infested with privacy violations: names of minor
children, names of informants, medical records, mental health records,
financial records, tens of thousands of social security numbers.

We were whistle blowers[1] and we sent our results to the Chief Judges
of 31 District Courts and those judges were shocked and dismayed and
they redacted those documents and they yelled at the lawyers that
filed them and the Judicial Conference changed their privacy rules.

But you know what the bureaucrats who ran the Administrative Office of
the United States Courts did? To them, we weren't citizens that made
public data better, we were thieves that took $1.6 million of their
property.

So they called the FBI, they said they were hacked by criminals, an
organized gang that was imperiling their $120 million per year revenue
stream selling public government documents.

The FBI sat outside Aaron's house. They called him up[2] and tried to
sucker him into meeting them without his lawyer. The FBI sat two armed
agents[3] down in an interrogation room with me to get to the bottom
of this alleged conspiracy.

But we weren't criminals, we were only citizens.

We did nothing wrong. They found nothing wrong. We did our duty as
citizens and the government investigation had nothing to show for it
but a waste of a whole lot of time and money.

If you want a chilling effect, sit somebody down with a couple
overreaching federal agents for a while and see how quickly their
blood runs cold.

There are people who face danger every day to protect us--police
officers and firefighters and emergency workers--and I am grateful and
amazed by what they do. But the work that people like Aaron and I did,
slinging DVDs and running shell scripts on public materials, should
not be a dangerous profession.

We weren't criminals, but there were crimes committed, crimes against
the very idea of justice.

When the U.S. Attorney told Aaron he had to plead guilty to 13
felonies for attempting to propagate knowledge before she'd even
consider a deal, that was an abuse of power, a misuse of the criminal
justice system, a crime against justice.

And that U.S. Attorney does not act alone. She is part of a posse
intent on protecting property not people. All over the United States,
those without access to means don't have access to justice and face
these abuses of power every day.

It was a crime against learning when a nonprofit corporation like
JSTOR, charged with advancing knowledge, turned a download that caused
no harm and no damage into a $92 million federal case.

And the JSTOR corporate monopoly on knowledge is not alone. All over
the United States, corporations have staked their fences on the fields
of education: for-profit colleges that steal from our veterans,
nonprofit standards bodies that ration public safety codes while
paying million dollar salaries, and multinational conglomerates that
measure the worth of scientific papers and legal materials by their
gross margins.

In the JSTOR case, was the overly aggressive posture of the Department
of Justice prosecutors and law enforcement officials revenge because
they were embarrassed that--in their view at least--we somehow got
away with something in the PACER incident? Was the merciless JSTOR
prosecution the revenge of embarrassed bureaucrats because they looked
stupid in the New York Times, because the U.S. Senate called them on
the carpet?

We will probably never know the answer to that question, but it sure
looks like they destroyed a young man's life in a petty abuse of
power.  This was not a criminal matter, Aaron was not a criminal.

If you think you own something and I think that thing is public, I'm
more than happy to meet you in a court of law and--if you're
right--I'll take my lumps if I've wronged you. But when we turn armed
agents of the law on citizens trying to increase access to knowledge,
we have broken the rule of law, we have desecrated the temple of
justice.

Aaron Swartz was not a criminal, he was a citizen, and he was a brave
soldier in a war which continues today, a war in which corrupt and
venal profiteers try to steal and hoard and starve our public domain
for their own private gain.

When people try to restrict access to the law, or they try to collect
tolls on the road to knowledge, or deny education to those without
means, those people are the ones who should face the stern gaze of an
outraged public prosecutor.

What the Department of Justice put Aaron through for trying to make
our world better is the same thing they can put you through. Our army
isn't one lone wolf, it is thousands of citizens--many of you in this
room--who are fighting for justice and knowledge.

I say we are an army, and I use the word with cause because we face
people who want to imprison us for downloading a database to take a
closer look, we face people who believe they can tell us what we can
read and what we can say.

But when I see our army, I see an army that creates instead of
destroys.  I see the army of Mahatma Gandhi walking peacefully to the
sea to make salt for the people. I see the army of Martin Luther King
walking peacefully but with determination to Washington to demand
their rights because change does not roll in on the wheels of
inevitability, it comes through continuous struggle.

When I see our army, I see an army that creates new opportunities for
the poor, an army that makes our society more just and more fair, an
army that makes knowledge universal.

When I see our army, I see the people who have created the Wikipedia
and the Internet Archive, people who coded GNU and Apache and BIND and
LINUX. I see the people who made the EFF and the Creative Commons. I
see the people who created our Internet as a gift to the world.

When I see our army, I see Aaron Swartz and my heart is broken. We
have truly lost one of our better angels.

I wish we could change the past, but we cannot. But, we can change the
future, and we must.

We must do so for Aaron, we must do so for ourselves, we must do so to
make our world a better place, a more humane place, a place where
justice works and access to knowledge is a human right.

    He says "army", sixteen or so times, and I wondered from what school of 
    thought on framing does that come.

We were talking about whether JSTOR's actions are ethical.  You're
shifting the subject to Malamud's choice of metaphor.

It is not even an unusual metaphor.  War is a common metaphor for a
struggle, even if it has nothing to do with arms.  LBJ's War on
Poverty did not involve fighting anyone in particular, and Nixon's War
on Cancer was carried out by doing medical research.  There was not
even an adversary, just a problem.

In this struggle, we confront cunning human adversaries.  The metaphor
of war will encourage researchers to stand firm, even at the cost
of sacrifices.

We have seen in this discussion that some people, placing their own
careers above all else, say that they (and everyone in their field)
must publish in a certain nonfree forum.  That attitude does not help
us win.

If researchers think of themselves as an army, we may put an end to
restrictive scientific publication.  Part of this is the conclusion
that organizations such as JSTOR, which help the enemy keep its power,
are wrong and harmful.

      But in the intangible domain of 
    intellectual pursuits, there is room for new institutions.

We have already made new institutions, some very successful such as
PLOS, but that did not sweep away the old restrictive institutions.
People in our own field continue to publish in forums that restrict
their writing.  Evidently making new institutions is not enough.

Aaron Swartz recognized the need to defeat the entities that suck our
colleagues into pseudo-publication.  His method was dangerous and he
was thwarted, but he had the right idea of what the issue is.

    Asking JSTOR 
    to change means one of two things: 1) asking them to violate their own 
    license agreements, or 2) convincing them to negotiate new license 
    agreements.  I'm sure that any advocate of free licenses such as GPL 
    would agree that option 1 is wrong and short-sighted.

You have misunderstood the GNU GPL both legally and ethically.

Legally, the GNU General Public License, or GNU GPL, is not a
contract.  Rather, it is based on copyright law.  But it does not
derive its legitimacy from copyright law, which is hardly a fount of
ethical legitimacy.

Ethical legitimacy does not come from laws or contracts except when
there is nothing more important at stake.  

The GNU GPL is ethical because it establishes and defends freedom for
the users.  Violating the GNU GPL in a substantial way means denying
freedom to other users, and that is what makes it wrong.

The contracts between JSTOR and journal publishers establish a system
of repression that ought to be abolished.  It would be right for JSTOR
to violate those contracts.  In practice, JSTOR could not get away
with that for any length of time--JSTOR would be sued.  So I don't
hope for a solution along that path.

But the people who run JSTOR are not working under duress.  They could
quit and say JSTOR is wrong.  They could shut it down.  Nothing stops
them -- except that they have convinced themselves that it is good to
be the velvet glove over the mailed fist.  We should tell them it is
bad.

Supposing that Aaron Swartz was aiming to make the JSTOR papers
available to the public, it would have been a victory to cheer and
celebrate.

      Asking MIT to coerce researchers to publish in open-access 
    venues in the name of freedom is hypocritical.

You've misrepresented me -- I did not advocate "open-access".  See
http://stallman.org/articles/free-scientific-publishing.html.

I don't agree with your idea of freedom either.  Respecting freedom
does not mean never making rules that say no.  It does not mean we
mustn't do anything firmer than say "Please don't."

The GNU GPL defends freedom by making a rule that says no.  When
people want to put the code into a proprietary program (one that will
not respect its users' freedom), the GPL says, "Stop!  You can't do that!"

If MIT researchers are being systematically pressured into providing
material for SIGGRAPH and others to restrict the public with, MIT
ought to systematically put a stop to it, saying "Stop!  You can't do
that!  You can't publish scholarly work in a way that restricts the
public!"

Establishing freedom in the scientific literature entails getting rid
of entrenched power.  As Frederick Douglass said, "Power concedes
nothing without a demand."

MIT and other universities can vanquish the journal publishers easily,
quickly, safely, and lawfully -- if they but decide to do so.  By
publicly condemning the journal publishers, and their front
organization JSTOR, we build the movement that can convince MIT to
take this action.

    If the proponents of open-access academic publishing want to capture 
    significant market share, they must convince individuals at the top of 
    their fields to lend their cachet to those publications.

That will be so if we reject stronger methods.

    I don't know whether I've communicated this well, so sorry if I'm 
    harping, but one of my concerns is that I don't want to see young 
    activism-minded people riled up to behave recklessly, nor see them get 
    smacked down or get PR.

I'd like to see them absolutely refuse to publish in nonfree journals.
That is an effective tactic, and carries no risk of prosecution, but
it requires people to feel strong enough commitment to overcome
counterpressure from those who say you "have to" do it.

Meanwhile, if someone else is more careful than Aaron Swartz, and succeeds
in doing what he apparently wanted to do, that would be a great victory.
The only bad thing about Swartz's attempt is that he was caught.

People could express their rejection of Amazon's DRM, and reading
under restrictive licenses, by participating in the experiment,
taking the Amazon gift certificate, and tearing it up immediately.

    Isn't that equivalent to donating 20 dollars to amazon?

That conclusion, which several people have asserted, presents a lesson
on how narrow economic thinking can lead to missing the point.

Aside from the naive estimate of Amazon's gain (recall that Amazon
makes some money from sales, too), that conclusion disregards
everything else about the protest.  It seems to ignore all except the
direct financial transation.

The idea here is to show the experimenters, pointedly and graphically,
that you're glad to help their experiment but you despise the "reward"
they offer.  By tearing up the certificate, you show that you refuse
to benefit from the "reward", and at the same time you use it up so
that they cannot offer it to the next participant.

Passing on the gift certificate to someone else would convey pointed
criticism to the experimenters.  Simply declining the "reward" would
fail to highlight the message, and they would be able to offer the
same certificate to someone else.

Tearing up the certificate would result in a small gain for Amazon
(I'd guess $12 to $16).  That's ironic, but it's a small thing, less
important than changing long-term MIT practices that promote Amazon.
If many people protest as I suggested, Amazon will not be glad.

It is possible to deny Amazon that small gain.  Here's an idea:
discard the certificate in a grand gesture, such as making it into a
paper airplane and throwing it out a window in the experimenters'
office, for someone unknown to pick up.  That would still make the
point, and avoid giving Amazon a tiny windfall.


I've since been informed that these gift certificates are not on
paper.  They are sent by email, subsequently.

That changes things, because whatever you might do later when you
receive that email, it would not convey any criticism to the
experimenters.

Has someone else got an idea for how to convince them to change their
"reward"?  Is there anyone here who wants to think constructively?

    The goal, then, is to compensate them with something LIKE cash that isn't -
    Amazon gift certificates fill that role for many people. Unless I'm
    overlooking something very obvious, there aren't any better alternatives.

You don't need an alternative that works better.  You don't even
really need an alternative that works just as well.  It would be
enough to find an alternative that works fairly well, and avoids the
ethical problem of this one.

People have suggested lots of alternatives.  I think there must be
various combinations of them that will work fairly well.  (You can
offer multiple options.)

If you offer several options, and some other experimenters join and do
the same, this set of choices could be described as "a $20 reward with
the usual choice of which ways we can give it to you."  That doesn't
promote Amazon -- even if it includes the Amex card that could be
spent on Amazon.

    Whoa whoa whoa, are you telling me that even Amex cards could be spent 
    at Amazon?!?!?! Shut. Down. Everything. I say we all open our wallets 
    and tear up anything that could potentially circulate into Amazon's 
    coffers; that will show them!

You waste your wit by aiming it at a straw man that nobody here has
proposed.

The point is to end MIT's practice of explicitly promoting Amazon,
not to block MIT students from doing business with Amazon.

    Unfortunately, I believe you do not legally have the GNU-like freedom to 
    put up your own signage on City signposts.

MIT hackers will not necessarily let that stop them.

I once put a sign "Barbidall Sq" on a lamp post in Wellesley where the
bus to Kendall Square stops.  It did not stay up long -- I suppose
some Vandalls removed it -- but people enjoyed it while it lasted.

    By reporting on this unfortunate and ill thought out exploit
    of yours when you were younger you reveal a continued level
    of immaturity and willingness to denigrate a whole class of
    people (Wellesley undergraduates) based on your preconceived

It's worse than you realized.  In just 11 letters I not only compared
the Wellesley undergraduates to Barbie dolls, but, by implication, the

So am I prejudiced against women and simultaneously prejudiced against
men?  Or is your idea of maturity too limited?

    Yes: the word you're looking for is "sexist".  You made a joke on the 
    basis of the sex of a group of students.

To call that sexism is stretching the concept -- but my joke didn't do
that anyway.  It ribbed both male and female students alike.

    so might feel that it's okay to point fingers at a group 
    of Wellesley students and laugh, for they are female and they commute to 
    MIT.

The joke points one finger at Wellesley undergraduates and another
similar finger at MIT undergraduates.  The idea that it mocks someone
for commuting, and the idea that it is aimed specifically at females,
is something you read into it.

If this constitutes "othering" the females, by the same token it is
also "othering" the males.  (I must be neuter.)

My joke mocked both sexes, but that does not make it "sexist", and no
matter how vehemently you repeat that claim, it will still be wrong.
Your bombast and ire is simply misplaced.

My joke is not sexist, because it ribs both men and women in the same

duck from that one side, but the other side looks quite different.

    People miscommunicate all the time, and I see nothing in
    what Richard wrote to indicate that he knows how this sign would be
    understood by others.

If this refers to the Wellesley students back then, I think they
understood it the same way I did -- as a harmless joke.

A friend who visited the Wellesley campus a couple of days later (to
gauge the reaction) reported hearing one student tell another, "I'll
meet you over there, at Barbidall Square."  This is not a lot of data,
but it rules out a general negative reaction.

    What makes you think that you, as a man, can utter a final
    pronouncement as to what behavior might or might not be oppressive to
    women in general?

My statement is as final as yours or anyone else's.  I think my
argument is conclusive, but you're free to think what you like.

    Gender-based oppression in society means that an apparently "unbiased"
    position (read: the unmarked case, male) is quite often a hurtful
    one.  

I know what yuo mean, but male as unmarked did not occur in my hack.

People who are presensitized to offense -- perhaps because they have
often born the brunt of intentional offense -- tend to overreact and
be too quick to take offense where they shouldn't.  I know this
because I am one of them: every day I see my work (and that of
thousands of others who worked on GNU) attributed to Mr. Torvalds.
Some of them know this is wrong and don't care, but most of them don't
know that what they are saying is wrong.  I have worked hard to stop
myself from taking offense at them.  I try to explain with good humor,
not condemnation.

I didn't intend to say anything about Danny Lewin, because I had no
association with that name.  Information about him only appeared later
in the discussion.  Cambridge is full of squares named after people I
never heard of, and I was surprised to find that name was actually
known to anyone here.  I'm sorry if my message offended someone with
strong feelings about him.

My feelings about the attacks of Sep 11, 2001, are different from most
Americans', since I avoided watching TV and getting traumatized.  I
spent that day writing an article warning about the danger that our
freedom would be the next target.  Unfortunately, this indeed
happened, as we have seen in the PAT RIOT Act, in the warrantless
wiretapping that Congress then legalized, in security theater, in the
war in Iraq, and now in the permanent-war bill that the ACLU is
asking people to oppose.

This attack has done far more harm to the US than the one on Sep 11,
and it is not over yet.  I suggest we remind people about this
continuing attack as well as the one ten years ago.

I put up the Barbidall Square sign for fun, and I think it was.  I
mentioned it here expecting it to be fun for everyone.  I was
surprised that anyone took it otherwise.

I regret unintentionally hurting anyone's feelings.  If someone I
didn't wish to hurt says "That hurts!", I am concerned.  Even if they
don't convince me my conduct was wrong, I could make an effort to
avoid the hurt, if this is asked rather than demanded.

But they did not ask for my concern and consideration -- instead they
accused me, unjustly, of bigotry.  Hurt feelings are daily life, but
an accusation of wrongdoing is much worse.  I will reject it at any
cost.  Catering to hurt feelings, though in principle I'm still
willing, has to come second.

The women who criticized were not so belligerent that we could not now
have a conversation.  I hope they will withdraw the accusation, and
bring this up with me (if they wish to) as a matter of hurt feelings.
I am willing to think about their positions if they will extend the
same willingness to mine.

    One doesn't require the intent of being sexist to be sexist.

It is impossible for an act to be sexist.  Sexism is prejudice based
on a person's sex.  Prejudice is an attitude, a mental state.  We
consider this attitude evil, and that's what makes the accusation a
grave one.

An act can result from prejudice, and we might infer prejudice from
certain acts.  But if a person doesn't have a prejudiced attitude (and
you said you don't think I do), there is nowhere in the act itself for
prejudice to be located.

One might still claim that the act was unfair.  That's a different
sort of judgment, since fairness is not a matter of attitude.  One can
do something unfair by mistake.  Thus, claiming a person's act was
unfair is not a grave accusation like claiming prejudice.  If you
accuse me of bigotry, I will fight to the end.  If you say I acted
unfairly, I will think about the issue.

Perhaps unfairness is what you really mean here.  If so, I suggest not
using the same word to describe a kind of unfairness and a mean
attitude.  Blurring that distinction is not a harmless confusion.  It
tends to lead to unfair acts (false accusations) and tends to build
hostility instead of resolving disputes.

I responded to Brooks' vicious false accusations with a true
accusation against him.  I think he asked for that.  Aside from that,
my responses explained my actions and my attitude, all directly
relevant to rebutting the false accusation made against me.

    3. In this environment, an action can have a sexist *effect*, even if
       it does not have a sexist *intention*, by contributing to this
       negative pattern.

I see what you are trying to talk about, but this way of talking about
it is a recipe for injustice.

When you say "a sexist *effect*", you surely mean an effect that
somehow is unfair to women.  It is possible for an action to do that.
But that is not sexism.

Sexism refers to prejudice, and it is a grave accusation.  Use the
same word to refer to a mere effect, which isn't prejudice, is
confusing -- and systematically unfair.  Every time you criticize an
action that way, the criticism carries with it a subtle and deniable
suggestion that the person is prejudiced.

Even if you have carefully analyzed the difference, you cannot expect
everyone that hears your words to have done so.  They can go away
thinking that the person you criticized was prejudiced.

I don't think that is coincidence.  I think that the concept of
"unintentional sexism" attempts to put the onus of prejudice on things
which are not prejudice.  That's not unjust.

If they are not prepared to argue against this, they might find it
very intimidating.  Those who want to teach people to avoid
certain actions might find this useful, in the short run.

In the long run, the confusion would undermine the disapproval of
sexism.  If people come to associate the word with unintentional
effects, not specifically with prejudice, their judgment of
unintentional effects (not sinful) will rub off on the word -- and
unless they work hard to make a distinction, that would affect their
judgments in cases of prejudice too.  We would no longer be able to
condemn bigotry adequately.

The idea of "unintentional sexism" is a conceptual confusion that does
wrong to individuals and undermines our condemnation of prejudice.  It
is not valid; it is a misapplication of the concept of sexism.

I don't think my messages in this discussion were unfair to women, but
such a question is always arguable.  However, I know they were not
sexist.

      In this environment, using non-free
    software or data formats can have the *effect* of eroding our
    freedoms, even if it does not have that *intention*, by contributing
    to this pattern.

That's true.  In fact, the issue of nonfree software exists solely at
the level of conduct.  Distributing nonfree software is mistreating
the users in a practical way; it isn't a matter of anyone's attitude.

Since "nonfree" categorizes the program, not the people involved with
it, it is hard for anyone to misunderstand and think it is about
someone's attitude.  So it does not encourage a confusion comparable
to "unintentional sexism".

    Also, in case anyone missed it, the big news yesterday from HTC is that they
    will no longer lock down the bootloaders on any of their devices

That sounds like an important step forward.  However, there is another
issue.  From what I've heard, most or all Android phones have nonfree
radio firmware that also controls the microphone, and can take control
of the CPU and replace the OS.  That is a serious security flaw.

Does anyone know if there is a model which doesn't have this flaw?

I read, a couple of days ago, that Google now uses DRM to block access
to movies on Android phones that have been rooted.  This has to be
part of our judgment of Android now.  If Google couldn't offer this
service in a way that respects people's freedom, it shouldn't have
offered it at all.

    Yes but Richard, your own hardware endorsement policy specifically
    excludes firmware from the requirements of Free Software:

    http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:Hardware/Endorsement_criteria

Our endorsement criteria reflect our view that the presence of
firmware inside the machine, firmware that doesn't get installed or
replaced as part of normal operation, is not in itself a fatal flaw.
Indeed, it might as well be circuitry.

However, when that firmware can turn the product into a listening
device, or install changes in your free operating system on remote
command, that is a pretty big security flaw.  That device doesn't HAVE
a bug, it IS a bug.  That's the issue I raised.

Strictly speaking, this issue is not about nonfree firmware.
If circuitry did the same thing, it would be the same problem.

    The radio firmware runs on the baseband processor, which is an
    auxiliary (and limited-purpose / cut-down) processor that runs in its
    own segregated subsystem, and is *not* available to the user for
    general purpose computing.  As far as I know, the baseband processor
    has no access to the microphone, it cannot "take control of the CPU",
    and it cannot "replace the OS".  It can operate the radios in the
    phone and communicate via a special-purpose bus with the CPU, and
    that's about it.

If you're right, maybe this model doesn't have the flaw I am talking
about.  I said that "most or all" Android phones have it.  My experts
told me about many models that have this problem, but I don't know
what whether they are all.  That is why I asked if anyone knew of an
exception.

If you have verified that in a certain model the firmware does not
control the microphone and cannot alter the installed operating
system, that is great news.  That might even be a good target for
installing free software to make a phone we could endorse.  Which
model is this?

This is based on the simplistic idea of "voluntary" use that I refuted

    Are there any reasonably usable distributed social networks?

There are some.  I know of pump.io (somewhat like Twitter) and Diaspora.

     What are the
    biggest challenges in doing so or designing such a system (beyond userbase
    & monetization, although not to trivialize that).

I loathe the word "monetization", which presupposes that the primary
question about any activity is how to profit from it, so I won't
think or speak in terms of that.

More generally, I can't answer because I don't know.  It is not my field.
I've never used any social networking system.

Do you want to work on building free distributed social networks?  If
so, I can put you in touch with someone who knows.

    I hate relying on facebook, but I use it because I think the opportunity
    cost is too high to not for me.

Implicitly you're saying that you don't appreciate the wrong of
pushing your friends and coworkers to be used by Facebook enough
to stop doing so.

    > to stop doing so.

    I believe there's a difference between encouraging others to use
    Facebook and not encouraging them to leave Facebook.

Indeed, there is a difference between promotion and neutrality.

If you aren't a used of Facebook yourself, and you say nothing about
it, that is neutrality.

If you make Facebook the easy way for people to contact you, that is
promotion of Facebook, albeit implicit.  Not neutrality.

    Maybe you don't think your friends and coworkers want to hear yet
    another "Facebook is evil" soapbox argument when they try to
    interact with you on Facebook.

You're talking about the way I campaign against Facebook, on public
forums, but that's not the only alternative to supporting Facebook.

For instance, you could tell people (when asked) simply "I don't have
a Facebook account" and say no more.

Or you could explain your opposition to each friend or coworker just
once.  That way, there is nothing to get tired of.

Arguments against Facebook become tiresome when they are mere whining
from people who won't take the most basic step to change things.
"Isn't it horrible that Facebook does all this to us?  Aren't we
pathetic for letting them?"

It changes everything when you tell per (*), "Sorry, I reject Facebook."
If person (**) asks why, you can then explain.  If person already knows,
you need not repeat the explanation.  A conversation with a person is
not like a discussion list.

Regarding Twitter, it is distinctly better than Facebook.  For
instance, it does not require that users give their real names,
or lots of other info about themselves.

these three bills:

  The <strong>Electronic Privacy Act</strong> would require a warrant

  The <strong>License Plate Privacy Act</strong> would protect you
  from government tracking when you drive.

  The <strong>Password Privacy Act</strong> would stop snooping bosses

The legislative session ends on July 31, and if the bills are not

Dan Ravicher of the Public Patent Foundation told me that he believes
MIT could legally adopt a defense-only patent contract like Twitter's.
If MIT does not want to do this, it could come up with arguments that
it is impossible.  Ravicher thinks they are mistaken, and in any case,
they would be excuses rather than real reasons.

In other words, we need to convince/pressure MIT to accept this
policy, and we should not accept "We can't, it's illegal" as an
answer.

    It is nonfree, but I always use the alternative and free client 
    OpenConnect instead:

    http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/

It is a good thing that the VPN lets users connect with free software.
I urge everyone to recommend openconnect, and NEVER suggest using
AnyConnect.  Please don't recommend a nonfree program!

    Of course, in either case, the VPN itself is a proprietary Cisco web 
    service.

Could you explain what you mean by "proprietary web service"?  The
concept of free bs proprietary is defined for programs, not for services.
See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/network-services-arent-free-or-nonfree.html.

about this service, I can't judge it.  Does it run in an MIT server,

    Entitlement spending is growing faster than GDP. The question isn't
    *if* entitlements
    will be cut, the question is *when* and *how*.

There is no need to cut any of them.  In the long run, we should raise
taxes to cover the spending.  In the short run, we need more deficit
spending to get out of the recession and put Americans back to work.

     Smart cuts now would mean
    the benefits will be there for people who need them in years to come.

Are you starting from the assumption that a government is like a
family and has a fixed amount of money it can spend?  Right-wingers
like to make that claim, but it is not true.

    The problem with pledges like this one and Americans for Tax Reform is they
    simplify complex issues into "for" and "against", which is good for
    politics but bad for governance.

Politics is the broad question of how to organize society.  I am not
sure what you mean by "governance", but I think it means some aspect
of how political decisions are made.  The political outcome is what
counts.  When stubborn people are determined to do harm to millions of
the vulnerable people in our country, we must hold firm against them.

    Why throw something out -- in this case, a perfectly good piece of
    electronics -- when it is in fact entirely repairable?

Its screen may be repairable, but its contempt for users freedom is
something there is no way to fix, as far as I have heard.  Has anyone
been able to run anything but iOS on an iThing?

    We'll also call computers "shoes" and "TV" and "kitchen", as sensors and
    compute units will be woven into everyday things.

If you're wise, you won't allow this in your home.

In theory there is nothing wrong with this.  In practice, the way
today's tech industry functions (and tomorrow's is likely to be
worse), they will be designed with surveillance and DRM.  They will be
designed to turn all your everyday activities into someone else's "big
data".

This is why I regard the "Internet of Things" as a cute name

    As computing platforms become more and more (1) ubiquitous and (2)
    interconnected, I wouldn't be surprised if everyone just started referring
    to computers as "nodes," given all the networks they'll be linked to.

Each network it talks to is one more vulnerability to various sorts of
abuse.  Portable phones today have been converted remotely into
listening devices, across the phone network, via a back door that they
generally have.

Some of us will still use them.

    However, if they're talking about huge mainframe systems, they'll

    I built a browser-based application that uses Web standards to provide a
    high-quality IM and video chat experience. My code is MIT-licensed, and all
    the dependencies are OSS.

Are the dependencies all _free software_?  Nearly all open source
programs are free, but there are a few exceptions.  See
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for an explanation of where the differences are.

Does this method depend fundamentally on common access to a server?
Would it be possible to make it work P2P?  Could a program such as
GNU Sipwitch help make that work?

The TSA decided recently to permit small swiss army knives on flights,
recognizing that these do not threaten the safety of the flight.

Congressman Markey, whose district includes parts of Cambridge and
some other adjoining towns, has introduced a bill to reverse this rare
bit of common sense.  He is running for the senate and must think this
will gain him support.

So I suggest people who live in Massachusetts tell him they want the
TSA to apply common sense and do not like this bill.

You could tell Markey that you are fed up with security theater, and
you appreciate even this tiny intermission that the TSA has offered.

    the state of Massachusetts:

    http://wap.myfoxboston.com/w/main/story/86769179/

I will look at that page, but the TSA policy affects the whole
country.  Perhaps this is a Massachusetts law that ought to be changed,
but that would have no effect on what we should say to Rep. Markey.

    I learned the following practical technique for "travelling" with a pocket
    knife from Ted Selker when he was at the Media Lab: discretely toss it in
    the bushes outside Logan; chances are it will still be there when you get
    back.

There are many ways to cope with TSA security theater restrictions.
I know a lot about them, since I fly pretty often in my travels.
I normally put my pocket knife in my suitcase.

The point, however, is that now we see that the TSA is starting to
consider reducing these petty pointless annoyances.  That is a lot
better than finding ways to cope with them!

So let's phone Markey and support the TSA's turn towards reason.
Let's not let techniques of coping with the problem distract us from
our opportunity to fix the problem.

"Cloud-based service" is a vague term (one might even say "nebulous").
It includes some practices that are harmful to users' freedom -- and others
that are ok.  Thus, the use of that term doesn't help understanding.

    We want to give scientists everywhere access to new 
    state-of-the-art automation tools, via an intuitive web platform.

This is starting to look like software as a service, a practice that
is bad because it denies people control over their computing.  (See
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html.)

Instead of doing that, you should release these programs as free
software, so that other labs can run them, and adapt and extend them
too.  Why not?

    We need a full-stack Django/Javascript developer who can deliver an 
    outstanding front-end UI and scalable back end.

I hope you will make sure all your Javascript code carries
a free software license that LibreJS can recognize.

    first visit of a particular browser for that day, overlay the landing 
    page with a paywall-like grayed-out screen, "What if you had to pay to 
    see this page?"  Have a sentence of explanatory text, with a link for 
    more info.  And have a button, "Thank Goodness It Ain't Elsevier", that 
    makes the faux paywall screen go away so people can see the page they 
    requested.

The basic idea is delighful, but I criticize a few details:

* Elsevier is not the only publisher that practices non-libre
  publication, so it would be good to mention others somehow, or some
  of the time.  For instance, SIGGRAPH is an important offender.

* The requirement to pay is not the worst thing about what they do.
  Worse is the ban on redistribution.  However, people tend to forget
  about that if they focus mainly on the fees.  See
  stallman.org/articles/free-academic-publishing.html.  I suggest
  tailoring the message to focus on freedom as much as on fees.

* It would be good to point people towards a campaign they can
  support.

      If this reduces my review load, I am all for it. On the other
      hand, most of the places I publish are under ACM and IEEE, and

      before going after the evil empires, we need to clean-up our own

We should demand that Elsevier and others publish all scientific
articles (old and new) under the free license CC-BY, perhaps with a
delay of 6 months for new articles.  This is an ethical requisite.

As for projects to index and correlate information better, that is a
totally different thing: a suggestion for future research.  It may be
a good suggestion, but in terms of ethics there's an enormous difference
between ceasing an injustice and deceloping new technology.

Restrictive scientific publication is an active wrong, so it's obvious
how to stop, and it makes sense to tell someone, "Stop it right now!"
It makes no sense to tell someone, "Make progress in science right
now!"

However, once these articles are published in a free manner, anyone
will be able to do such research, and the NSF could fund some.
Perhaps the W3C could fund some, too.

There is no difficulty in doing free scientific publication.
We know this because PLOS already does it and is quite successful.

Registration using eventbrite is a bad thing because it requires
running nonfree software (Javascript code, see
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html).  It also gives
the names of the attendees to a company, and those names are none of
that company's business.

I will write politely to the people associated with the event to ask
them to change how they handle registration.  It would be good for
others to raise the issue with them too.

Meanwhile, what I've read about Tango makes it seem like a grave
invasion of privacy.  If I understand correctly, which I'm not sure
of, it is designed to make a 3d map of every room it is brought into.
Is this true?  It would be very nasty to sneakily map the inside of
buildings just because someone carries a tangophone into it.

I'm not sure what kind of sensors it uses, so I am not sure whether it
can map a room from inside a pocket or pocketbook.  Does anyone know?

Perhaps those who attend the meeting (preferably having avoided
eventbrite) can ask about these points and find out to what extent
this problem is real.

       Tango uses a structured light sensor, I believe by primesense.

       1. Optic technology cannot map anything from your pocket,

Yes -- so it's not as bad as it might conceivably have been.
It might still be bad.

								 they also
       cannot run the camera app just like that to collect data due to power
       limitations

Maybe they can't run it "just like that" (i.e., all the time), but
they can run it when and where they want to.  Like maybe the first
time anyone brings one into a room they are interested in.

So this technical limitation is not enough to make them harmless.

    The advice on their web site seems to be written from the perspective of
    "patent everything! contact us immediately!"

In the software field, patents threaten all software developers and
users.  Absent a "defensive use only" patent policy like Twitter's --
which MIT does not have -- getting a computational idea patent is
doing harm to society.

If you want to avoid getting a patent, I can try to find you help.
The way to make this certain is to publish the idea (or have someone
leak it for you) and wait a year.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/limit-patent-effect.html for the way
to fix the overall problem of computational idea patents.

    If your intention is "defensive use only", it may still be the "better
    of two evils" to assign the invention to MIT via TLO rather than not
    patent it and let, say, Apple or other known serial lawsuit starter to
    take your invention, modify it slightly and patent it in their name,
    which might come back to hurt you.

There are two errors there.

1. You can't assume that patenting it for MIT will result in
"defensive use only".  If MIT decides to use the patent to restrict
others, you will have shafted everyone.

2. Legally, the prior publication of the idea is enough to
invalidate anyone else's patent.

    If your idea is stolen by a large company (and by "stolen" I mean
    "claimed, patented, and viciously protected as their own idea"), they
    tend to be able to afford whatever compensation it takes in order to
    continue stealing your idea.

I don't think it makes sense to talk about "compensation".

The point is that if A gets a patent and sues company B, B can cite
your prior publication in court to invalidate the patent.  The case
would not be A, against you.

If you had got a patent for MIT, B would cite that patent to
invalidate A's patent.  Not very different.

In either case it is A against B, not A against you; in either case,
the outcome will depend on how much resources B has to resist.

Please don't talk ambiguously about "the BSD license".  There are two
different BSD licenses, and the difference is significant.  See

Both the BSD licenses are pushover licenses.  Why let people put your

When considering whether to give MIT a patent that threatens software,
please think about the well-being of the field, not just your own
short-term interests.  Every computational idea patent is a minefield
for software developers.  Even if you might gain from planting mines,
you still should not do it.  Please don't let MIT induce you to do it.

    An compromise in some cases is to file the patent, but waive rights to
    royalties for specific purposes.  Most common is to reserve the right to
    use the patent to "fight back" litigation;

That is what we call "defensive use only".  It is ethical to get a
computational patent if you do that.  If you could be sure, before you
offer MIT the chance to get the patent, that MIT would agree to that,
it would be a sensible course of action.

The problem is, you can't be sure MIT will agree to that.  If you tell
MIT about a patentable idea, and MIT rejects defensive use only, it
may be too late for you to prevent MIT from getting the patent and using
it for aggression.

     another is to allow libre
    (Free) software, or even general open source software,

[Correcting side issue]
In practice, these two options are almost equivalent, because it is
very rare for a program to be open source but not free.

I've found that a lot of people hold the misunderstanding that there
are many open source programs which are not free.  Often that goes
with the belief that free = GPL'd.  Not so.  See
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for all these points.
[End side issue]

The reason I don't encourage people to get computing patents and
license them gratis to free software is that would be using the
patents to attack nonfree software.  But the big patent aggressors
such as Apple have a lot more patents to attack free software with.

We need to aim for patent disarmament in computing, and therefore we
should not aim to get patents and start threatening anyone with them.

I was thinking of trying to answer the survey, until I saw the part

You may be right, but that's a different question.
You're talking about how things got the way they are
whereas I'm trying to rouse people to push for change.

There is always an explanation for a harmful practice,
but that doesn't mean we should take it lying down.
So how about seriously asking them to offer an alternative
prize in their raffle?

That's a small step.  If I were doing the study, I would go further
than that.

See http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/amazon-escalates-its-battle-against-hachette/
which explains how Amazon is cracking the whip at even major publishers
and provoking condemnation.  Now's the time to jump on the wave.
If Amazon gets even bigger it will start bullying in other fields.

Please don't buy from Amazon.  See stallman.org/amazon.html.

    Maybe you should make it "A $50 gift certificate to any place you
    want (within reason)."

This would be an improvement compared with the current usual practice.
It is almost as good as giving cash.

It's not _exactly_ equivalent to giving cash, because the people doing
the study have to buy the gift certificate of whichever company the
person chooses.  This involves them in doing business with the company.
That would not be the case if they gave cash.

Still, it would be a substantial improvement.

    Lest people lose track in all the meta, I'd like to remind all that we 
    are gathering this data for science and would still love your input.  
    The survey can be found at
    https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/csail-related

Since you were kind enough to change your rewards in response to my
complaint, I decided to try to answer the survey for you.  But I could
not answer, or even see the questions, because surveymonkey requires
running nonfree Javascript code.

I can see that some of that code is malware (it sends data to Google
Analytics).  I don't know what the rest of it does.

In addition, this method means the surveymonkey company gets all the
data, and will surely share it with Big Brother.

It is possible to do a survey straightforwardly in plain HTML.
Would you please do your surveys that way in the future?

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html for an explanation
of this issue.

I haven't seen them, but the idea of a "smart bench" is ominous.

Merely educating people about how to avoid surveillance at the pain of
some inconvenience is not a solution for society.  Most people simply
won't do it, so it won't help them.

To reestablish privacy, we need to make sure systems are designed so
they don't surveil.

You're taking a cheap shot by focusing on the words rather than the

have said,

    Gentoo offers nonfree programs through its primary package system.

The situation with GNU tar is quite different.  A general tool can be
used on any sort of data, including a nonfree program.  GNU tar can
untar a nonfree program, but will do so only if you go out of your way
to tell it to.  It does not suggest proprietary programs to the user

    there not a little irony in the fact that distros are marked "nonfree" for

I should have said, because they present nonfree programs to the user

A free distro's package installation commands will install whatever

EFF: MIT was not neutral in the Aaron Swartz case.  It aided the
prosecution.

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/mit-aarons-swartz-case-not-neutral-not-leading-not-standing-technologists

Even more fundamentally, MIT never told the government that
Swartz's use of MIT's network was not unauthorized.

http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/56881544082/the-mit-report-on-aaronsw

That would have made the case disappear.

This leads to wonder: has MIT taken any steps to make things worse?
For instance, has it established policies declaring such uses the MIT
network to be clearly "authorized", thus preventing prosecution of a
future Aaron Swartz?  Or has it done the opposite and increased the
future threat?

Does anyone know?

Even if certain usage is generally blocked, or requires a password,
MIT could declare for legal purposes that it is "authorized".

    I'm guessing that, for most people in/around CSAIL, trying to fight 
    police-state technological infrastructure right now would mean risking 
    their careers and livelihoods.

"To fight the police-state technological infrastructure" includes
actions as diverse as choosing not to carry a cell phone and releasing
information about government crimes.

If you become a whistleblower like Snowden, it seems plausible you
would be prosecuted.  At the same time, it seems clear you would not
be hassled about having no cell phone.  That statement is so vague
that it is effectively FUD.

    I - We're going to a protest. People should come.
	[Unless it is a CSAIL specific protest, like storming the director's
	 office, which is room 32-G430 by the way, in which case it is A.]
    A - We're having beer at 5:30 this Friday. People should come. 

This juxtaposition speaks volumes.  CSAIL endorses inviting people to
use alcohol but not inviting them to take political action.  That
conveys a perverse idea of citizenship.  The idea appears to be that
people should drink and forget about how bad things are, rather than
working to make them better.

This is not proper conduct for an educational institution.




    As to tailgaters--I am not sure how to control this.  I have told 
    people waiting at the outside doors that I am not allowed to let 
    others into the building after hours.

As one who has asked others to let me in through these doors, I thank
those that have helped me, and I believe I should help others in the
same manner when it is my turn.

There is no particular reason for those doors to be locked, anyway.
It is a nuisance practically, and it encourages a spirit of fear and
distrust that is more than a nuisance.  Let's leave them open.





      Is 
    there a simple way to turn off the annoying sound and get back to work, 
    but still have security personnel come and investigate?  Are we being 
    encouraged to believe that any alarm we don't know the cause of heralds 
    a dangerous interloper that we should challenge?

This isn't a top-secret facility--we don't need to call the police
just because there is a possibility some unknown person has walked in.
I expect the police would be annoyed to be called so frequently.

A technical approach could narrow down the conditions.  Install a
weight sensor in the area on the inside of the door.  If the sensor is
triggered while the door alarm is on, and if the alarm is not disabled
within the next minute after that, then consider the situation
serious.





Perhaps we should simply get rid of these couches, and invite people
to bring old used couches and chairs to replace them.  Over time,
new ones will appear to fill the spaces available.






We would not have problems like this with mechanical keys.

I am very concerned about the potential danger of Emerald's device
that tracks peoples movements, even small ones like breathing and
heartbeat, even from outside the apartment.  The use of the device for
medical care is admirable, but I see a great potential for use for
massive surveillance of everyone at home.  I am concerned that the
device could be used to track everyone's movements and actions, at
home and in public places.  Insurance could pressure everyone to have
one of these devices, as it now pressures people to carry fitbit
surveillance.  https://stallman.org/articles/emerald-is-orwellian.pdf
describes how it could go.

So I went to the presentation last night.  They described how they,
today, respect privacy and avoid tracking anyone but the patient.  I
believe they are sincere and have good intentions.  However,
preventing nasty use of such a product takes more than good
intentions, and they did not show they realized the extent of the
challenge.

If their startup succeeds, investors will take control.  Later it will
probably be bought out and subsequent management may not care about
anything but profit.  Or the state may demand using the product to
surveil people.  It could be that the only way for the company's
owners to resist that demand is to shut it down, as Ladar Levison did
to Lavabit.  That is not feasible in a corporation with other
investors.

The presenters said the device can identify people by their gait; they
said that gait identification is so effective that gaits could be used
like fingerprints.  It might be capable of identifying all the people
in a store or museum, and tracking each one.

I wonder if it can tell what you type on a keyboard from outside your
apartment, or what space you fill in on a paper ballot from outside
the polling place.

Since I did not wish to disrupt the event, I waited until the audience
had no more questions, then started to bring up these issues.  I was
shouted down after a minute or two, and falsely accused of interfering
with the event.  I pointed out how I had waited, and said that I would
willingly yield to anyone in the audience.

Many in the audience did then have questions, which went on for
perhaps 20 minutes.  When they were finished and no more hands went
up, the presenters tried to insist there could be no further
discussion.  I spoke again, saying how the product would be admirable
if it were used only for medical care, but that that would be
difficult to ensure -- it might require passing laws.  Were they
thinking about this?

At that point, I was again shouted down, attacking me for my
disapproval of Microsoft.  Since I had not stated my views about
Microsoft, the audience was being asked to condemn them without
hearing anyone advocate them.  I had not had a chance to address the
issue at hand, let alone bring up that tangent.  I said this was
unfair.

I should have said, "Would you like me to present my views about
Microsoft, so that the others could judge them properly?"  But I did
not think of those words until later.


Later I realized that Emerald was doing something today that is
probably an injustice: getting software patents.  I say "probably"
because I don't know the details.  Perhaps they will use the patents
only defensively, which would be legitimate.  See
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/software-literary-patents.html,
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/limit-patent-effect.html and
https://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/llj/pdfs/45_1_stallman.pdf

I agree in the abstract with those words, but the kicker will be in
the word "appropriate".  Politicians will say they agree with this,
then consider only regulations that are nowhere near sufficient.

The kinds of regulations that might actually solve the problem
(see https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html)
are generally not considered at all.

Please do try.

Does the device have a universal back door?  I expect it does -- they
use the term "internet of things", and that seems to be taken for
granted in what I call the "internet of stings."

Is the device run by proprietary software?

Proprietary software, with the universal back door, makes the device
vulnerable to any kind of abuse by any party that can force the
manufacturer (or one of its staff) to comply.  We know the US
government does such things.  Australia is now considering a law to do
authorize it.

The only way to build a product that tends to resist such sabotage
is to make the software free so that the users have control over it.

This would endanger the security of Americans.  The main threat to our
security nowadays is cruelty by the state.

The state does not have to be a "bad guy", but when companies control
it, that's what it is.  And now, with a president that revels

It is not proper to announce sales events on a list meant for

    Dd and a live linux or freebsd distro.

       	          ^ GNU/

(Linux alone won't do the job; you need a GNU/Linux system.  dd comes
from the GNU part.  See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html for
more explanation.)




    I recommend only using FreeBSD because of the superior license agreement and 
    lack of the linguistic police.

Isn't it a bit of an exaggeration to describe a message of correction
as the act of "police"?  I have made no demands; I have only explained
the situation.  If you firmly intend to attribute my work to Linus
Torvalds, I will not try to stop you.  As an ACLU member, I would
oppose anyone who tried to stop you.  I will only say what you've done
is not right.

I've asked people to give the GNU Project equal mention, with
reference to a file which explains the reasons why.  Each person on
this list can now decide whether to heed those reasons.  You have a
right to respond with exaggerated accusations, if you wish--but
wouldn't you rather keep it on a higher level?











    Note that 'dd' in current FreeBSD also comes from GNU coreutils.  As does 
    'cat'. Aka the license agreement is the same.  I'm sure rms can weigh in 
    in a day or two on whether or not he wants to police GNU/FreeBSD as well,

See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#bsd.
(That file answers all the usual questions about the relationship
of GNU and Linux.)




    It's true that the folks at FSF decided to rewrite "dd" and create  
    their own "dd". That's because they wanted a new version of the  
    program with long options and the more restrictive license agreement.

That's mistaken on every point, including the history.

Paul Rubin gave us GNU dd in 1988; at the time, as far as I know, no
other free dd program existed.  There was a dd in the BSD system, but
it was proprietary, like the rest of BSD at that time.

Our goal was to complete a free software operating system as soon as
possible.  Therefore we used existing free software whenever it would
serve.  If a free dd program had existed--under the revised BSD
license, or the original BSD license, or any other free software
license--we would have used it.  But there was none.

I don't know why the BSD people wrote another dd program.  Perhaps
they did not know we had one; perhaps they wanted to avoid GPL-covered
software.  In any case, having two free programs to do this job is
somewhat of a waste, but that kind of waste is not a really bad scene.
A really bad scene is when there is NO free program to do the job.

Bridj has a terrible ethical flaw: it requires users to identify
themselves.  We should demand that Bridj make anonymous use possible,
and oppose it in all possible ways until it agrees.

Promotion for Bridj presents it as "relaxing" and convenient.  In
effect, it invites you to value convenience more and freedom less.
That attitude is what has made it so easy for companies to take away
so much of people's privacy, so that attitude is what we need to
oppose.

This might be an important step forward -- whether it is one depends
on details.  If the charges for publication are reasonable, and if
they exempt authors with no research funds from paying personally, the
option 1 is an ethical one.

However, ACM won't be an ethical publisher until it gets rid of
options 2 and 3.  So we need to keep pushing.  We aren't there yet.

I suggest organizing a campaign for MIT people to write to demand a
change in these repression plans.  It would be good to set it up so
that people cc their letters to a site that will publish them,
so that the MIT administration can't cover them up.

    If you're using a 64-bit Linux machine,

I think that's a misunderstanding; you surely don't run just Linux
on such a machine.

Are you talking about using the GNU+Linux system?  If so, please give
the GNU Project equal mention, rather than giving credit only to Mr
Torvalds.  You're talking about my life's work here.

A thesis ought to be published under a free license; MIT ought to
adopt that policy.  But until it does, if your thesis is interesting
enough that someone wants to publish it as a book, that will probably
call for changes.  That gives you another opportunity to negotiate:
"I'd love to clean up my thesis and publish it as a book, provided
it's done the ethical way, under a free license."

Stewart Brand tried once to convince me to support nuclear power.
His arguments were faulty.

Regarding Mark Lynas, there is some evidence he has sold out to
industry.  See http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_27042.cfm.

It appears the film is meant to try to win support for nuclear power
plants.  After the Fukushima meltdowns, we ought to recognize that
nuclear power is very dangerous.  To clean them up will take decades
and cost billions, and it could easily have been far worse.  A worse
disaster may still occur there, if another earthquake or tsunami
happens.

I wonder if we could find an expert on the danger of nuclear power
to come to this showing.

It is certainly possible to be "too cautious".  In the US, that's
standard practice.  How else can one describe what they did today,
paralyzing an entire large metropolitan area to search one
neighborhood for a fugitive?  In the US, just say the word "terrorist"
and lots of people start being way too cautious, and the TSA eats it
up.

Please don't promote fear of shadows.  It was sheer luck that the
shootout occurred near this building.  The bombers stole a car and
drove away, so evidently they had no plan to come into Stata.  The
people who hacked the doors were probably MIT people.  Maybe they
consider the pox locks an injustice, as I do (which is why this
particular lab member does NOT have the MIT pox card).

4 people killed in a week is not a lot compared with the background
level of deaths in the US.  It's not as many as in the Texas
explosion.  Car accidents in the US kill around 100 people a day, and
surely grievously injure hundreds more.  Every death or injury is a
sad thing, but the fact is that many happen every day, and we should
not let these few upset us disproportionally more than the others.
Let's make an effort not to get bent out of shape about them, so that
we can resist when people try to cite them as an excuse for tyranny.
(This was already cited as a reason to vote for CISPA.  See
http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/house-passes-privacy-killing-cybersecurity-bill-despite-white-house-veto-threat.)

As this week shows, chemical plants are the bigger danger.  It is
straightforward to reduce the danger if only we had the political will
to do it.  MIT people might be able to develop better monitoring
technology for preventing these explosions -- it is one area in which
"the Internet of things" might do good without violating any human
being's privacy.

    We understand from MIT police that the building is safe but nobody
    should be going on campus at this time.

I never heard any convincing reason why we shouldn't.  A friend called
the WBZ newsroom (he knows people there), and they told him they had
not heard any reason why people should stay home.  Just "You're not
supposed to" -- which is not convincing.

I read an announcement this evening that this was cancelled and the T
is now running again.  Perhaps common sense has prevailed.

    Some people's insensitivity is unbelievable, one death is too many,

Keeping our heads is not insensitive.

Many people died violently this week, as every week.  I think each of
those deaths was a bad thing.  However, regretting deaths does not
mean it is wise to lose our heads over them.

If we would like to reduce deaths, it is crucial to separate the big
causes of death from the small and occasional ones: in other words, to
maintain a sense of proportion.  Otherwise, we could become obsessed
with one death and neglect the opportunity to prevent many deaths.

    And do we know that the brothers didn't enter Stata?

Do you mean, even popping in for a moment?  I can't figure out about
that, but don't worry about it -- the building was checked on Thursday
night and found safe.

Anyway, I was explaining why it is implausible that the deactivated
locks had to do with the bombers.  It is clear now that they had no
plan on Thursday; they were improvising everything.  That doesn't fit
with the idea that they were doing something carefully prepared in
advance.

If you search for unlikely possibilities to worry about, you could
worry yourself silly every day of the year.

    Because Stata apparently attracts thieves, I do appreciate the locks at 
    night when the building is largely empty and I feel they are worth the 
    marginal reduction in privacy.

It's possible that thieves deactivated the locks.  I doubt it, because
(if my memory serves) most thefts in Stata are committed during the
day when those doors are open anyway.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.)

I agree it is useful to have locked doors, but they should not spy on
us.  This building is vulnerable to thieves because so many people
have to work in open areas and can't lock office doors -- but that can
be fixed.  In Sussman/Abelson's neighborhood, it has been fixed.

    You have no evidence of this.

The evidence is in the news reports about what the two suspects did on
Thursday night.  I stand by my conclusions on that basis.

Perhaps when you say "no evidence" you mean "no absolute direct
proof".  But there are other kinds of evidence.  To negate all
evidence other than absolute direct proof leads to giving many
unlikely scenarios too much credence and weight.

    These are wildly irresponsible claims

The wildly irresponsible claims are the claims that we should be
seriously worried about implausible scenarios -- for which there
really is no evidence whatsoever.

When people argue about security/repression measures, it is quite
common that they bring out danger scenarios that are not impossible
but unlikely.  These scenarios should not get much weight; but if
the only way to exclude one is to present absolute direct proof
it didn't/can't happen, they will get more weight than they merit.
This will bias the whole discussion.

Thus, a central part of defending a rational level of security, rather
than too much, is exactly the sort of point I've made: that certain
scenarios are implausible based on what we know.  We can determine
quite a bit about what other people have done based on what fits their
observed behavior.  We should not neglect this ability when discussing
need for security.

    We had an armed and desparate terrorist who was possibly wearing a 
    suicide vest, at loose in the Boston area with his whereabouts 
    unknown.

Not unknown.  They had tracked him to Watertown.

I am glad that they caught the suspect, but the shutdown of the whole
city was not necessary or helpful for that.

	     And you don't think there was a possible public safety issue?

That's not what I said.  I said that there was no reason to shut down
the whole city.

There was a public safety issue...in Watertown.

    Shutting down Boston for a day may cost a few million dollars in lost
    productivity, but if it prevents this guy from planting another bomb
    (handful killed, dozens injured) or dissuades someone else from tryng a
    similar stunt,

On the contrary, the chance of causing millions of dollars in damage
might encourage a terrorist.

    As another aside, when a disaster like the Marathon bombings occur it seems
    inappropriate and unfeeling
    to remark that there are other worse disasters.

Across the US, many have joined in hyping up the significance of this
particular crime.  I think they are afraid that they will be labeled
as "unfeeling" if they don't.

Many organizations this week made statements about how their "hearts
go out" to those harmed by this crime.  There was no such outpouring
for the deadlier events of the week, such as the explosion in Texas,
or the bombings in Iraq, or the earthquake on the Iran/Pakistan
border, or the earthquake in China, or the avalanche in Colorado.  Or
the hundreds of other Americans who were shot dead this week, as every
week.  Every one of those persons is likely to be missed and mourned
by some, even though we don't know them.

If these statements represent our sensitivity to human suffering, why
is our sensitivity so narrow?

Putting the Boston crime in proportion is not just theoretically
correct, it's urgently necessary.  The exaggeration of that crime's
significance is fueling pressure for unjust security/repression
measures in the US, Canada, Germany, to list only the cases I know
about.  Our country and the world desperately need a sense of
proportion now.

    Richard suggested that since the chase moved to Watertown, that was
    evidence that things were OK in Cambridge. I don't think that is even
    convincing in hindsight -- law enforcement spent most of the day at
    the Cambridge address of the suspects and there was a tense situation
    there with scores (or more) of officers.

They were investigating the suspect's home, in which they found
possible bombs.  This may have required blocking streets and even
evacuating some buildings, but did not call for shutting down all of
Cambridge, let alone all of Boston.

The crucial thing we Americans need to keep in mind is that the level
of terrorist violence in the US is so low already that no additional
measures are needed or even useful.

There are some 10,000 gun murders a year in the US, and there were
three bomb murders.  If we care about all Americans' life equally,
should we focus on the latter?  That's as useful as trying to speed up
a part of a program where it spends only .03% of the time.  Terrorist
violence in the US is such a tiny fraction of all the violent death
and injury in the US that it's the wrong place to focus if you hope to
reduce violence.

If you want to speed up the program, work on the parts where it spends
a lot of time.  If you want to reduce murder in the US, enact gun
control.  (Bonus: with better gun control, maybe the Tsarnaev brothers
would not have had guns.)  If you want to reduce other violent death,
enforce safety regulations on chemical plants, mines, oil drilling
platforms, and so on.

We need to redirect the public discussion away from the ineffective
focus on the few casualties of terrorism, and onto reducing the big
causes of avoidable deaths and injuries.

    What's the most attractive target? Maybe a redline train someplace
    between Park Street and South Station. What's the most attractive
    time? For maximum damage and greatest ease, let's say between 8 and
    9am.

Based on the experience of London, you are greatly overestimating the
likely casualties from an attack on a subway train.  Furthermore,
trains are designed so that they stop if the driver takes his hand off
the throttle, so attacking the first car would not change much.

But that's just a detail.  Here's the principal point.

This possibility was more on Tuesday than on Friday.  If it wasn't a
reason to shut down the subway on Tuesday, when the suspects were
unidentified and at large and could have left bombs on the train
without even being noticed, then it wasn't a reason on Friday when one
was dead and the other had gone to ground.

I hope you don't think the subway should have been closed on Tuesday
and kept closed for however long it took to find them.

Violent death and injury go on all the time, even in Boston, but it
usually does not impinge much on our attention.

The Boston metro area has a little over 1% of the population of the
US.  That means it probably has around 1 traffic fatality per day, and
quite a few serious traffic injuries per day.  In the course of one
week, this adds up to a number comparable to the bombing and the
pursuit.

The latter were more spectacular, and heavily publicized, so it is
understandable that they make a bigger emotional impression, but an
explanation for a mistake is not a good reason for it.

I am not trying to "trivialize" the bombing, just as you're not trying
to trivialize the traffic casualties.  I suggest that we maintain a
sense of proportion.  Every death or serious injury is a sad thing,
even when they happen to people we don't know.  But that is no reason
to get overwrought about one specific event.

You make an impassioned plea for respect for a disproportionate
reaction, on the grounds that it flows from an emotional tendency that
humans are often prone to.  You may be right.  But we don't have to
yield to that tendency.  Humans also have the ability to resist it.

More will resist it if they see the rational arguments against that
conclusion, and why it is important to follow them.  Presenting them
is something I know how to do, and I expect it will be useful for some
even if not for you.

I don't know how to say things in a way that could persuade you out of
your emotional state.  That calls for skills that I don't have, and
perhaps also for knowing you much better.  I do the job I know how to
do.

The person best placed to persuade you to adopt a sense of proportion
is you.  Now that you've recognized that you are having a negative
reaction to rationality about an issue of public importance, due to an
understandable (but not valid) human emotional tendency, you could
decide to reevaluate your feelings about it, if you wish.

Finally, you argue that anyone who won't subordinate rational
arguments to this irrationality should be ignored by all.  In effect,
you claim that this particular irrationality deserves a pass from
rational criticism, and to protect it everyone should close their eyes
against rationality that challenges it.

People who agree with you are free to ignore this message.

You have more information than I do about gun violence.  It is less
than I estimated: 6000 instead of 10000.  Only 900 Americans a year
are shot dead by strangers.  I appreciate the factual correction, but
I don't think it affects my point.

The point is that if we want to prevent a significant number of
violent deaths, we need to work on the phenomena that cause many
violent deaths -- and terrorism in the US isn't one of them.

Even 900 deaths is far more that the recent bombing and manhunt in
Boston.  And the other gun killings do count.  I think it is just as
bad when a woman is killed by her boyfriend as when a sports spectator
is killed by a stranger.  If someone is killed because a dispute
escalated, that's bad too.  So my point stands.

    This is a very good point: causing harm without intent is an accident,
    and causing harm with an objective has a clear boundary (even suicide
    bombing falls under this category -- it's over once the objective is
    achieved).  Causing harm for harm's sake is unbounded, 

This comes down to saying, "Consider the worst imaginable case,
never mind how unlikely it is."  That isn't wise judgment.

Accidents in industrial plants are bounded by the number of industrial
plants.  If they all exploded, no more damage could be done.  In
practice, only a small fraction of them explode, but that still adds
up to a lot of damage.

The activity of terrorists is bounded by their capabilities, which are
generally much less than the worst you can imagine.  But in practice
they don't reach those bounds.  They are not super-villains, or even
trained professionals.  Every time they try something, lots of things
can go wrong and thwart them.

Their capabilities were much reduced once one was dead and the other
was hiding.  If a shutdown wasn't needed before that, how could it be
needed after that.

    Many have pointed out that the lockdown actually worked against the
    objective of law enforcement -- the suspect was only found after the
    lockdown was lifted and someone noticed his hiding place.  If you
    criticize the police for making this mistake in the first place, is it
    because you think the lockdown was their goal?

Shutting down Boston was a decision, not an accident, so at some level
it was their goal.  I expect it was a means to some other end, not an
end in itself.  As for what that end was, I can only speculate.

My theory is that the authorities made a calculation that if the
bombers attacked again and caused more casualties, people wanted the
authorities to "do something".  The shutdown was "doing something", in
capital letters.  Someone said on this list, "You can't be too
cautious".  I think the authorities decided to cater to that feeling,
even though it was objectively counterproductive to do so, and figured
that people would convince themselves there was a good reason for it.

This monumental acts of caution is
likely to inspire others in the future.

    There are a few events and considerations that I think are relevant to 
    the decision making process that led to the lockdown and that I don't 
    think have been mentioned yet...
    - managing false reports of the suspect
    - defining an area for a lockdown

Police are used to false reports of sightings.
They have the resources to deal with them.
Reducing those is a minor gain, not worth tremendous damage.

The US has a century of experience of manhunts for armed killers with
cars and subway trains going.  It doesn't require shutting down a
large city.

    Yes -- it's possible that, if anything, the lockdown had a *positive*
    effect on Boston's morale, by increasing our sense of community
    and dramatically displaying the dedication of local law enforcement.

You might be right -- but if that's the basis for justifying the
shutdown, in effect you're saying it was security theater but lots
of people loved the show.

    Alternatively, suppose people have indeed learned the precedent that 
    they can shut down the city, e.g. by phoning in a hoax that a terrorist 
    is on the loose.  If they choose to do this instead of killing people, 
    wouldn't you say that's an improvement?

Under the hypothesis that from now on terrorists use only hoaxes, I'm
not sure it is an improvement.  I'd estimate the loss at 100 million
dollars (100 dollars for working 8 hours, times a million people).  If
it was only 50 million dollars, that is still tremendous.  That much
economic damage can kill people, indirectly.

However, I don't expect this to teach terrorists to use hoaxes.
Someone pointed out that hoaxes are likely to get ignored.  The worry
is that this will be an added incentive to try real bombs.

      Though the
    Tsarnaevs "only" managed to kill four people (and to maim a few dozen), it
    seems their *goal* (to whatever extent they thought it through)
    was basically just to murder as many innocents as possible.  This, I think,
    is precisely the property that scares people about terrorism (or, say, the
    Aurora or Newtown shootings), and is what differentiates that class
    of events from earthquakes, car crashes, and the like.

I'm sure you're right that this is why people react the way they do.

    Tell me your definition of "lost him" then. Letting him espace by
    1 mile, 2 miles, 10 miles, 100 miles, or to New York?

At what height does a person become "tall"?  6 feet?  6'1"?

The point is that they knew roughly where he was.

Those who seek an excuse for the shutdown are exaggerating, and
calling for unlikely extreme scenarios to be treated as significant.
That leads to taking painful precautions against things that won't
happen.

    Also I don't see the point of mentioning death proportion of car
    accidents and earthquakes. We should minimize tragedies in every
    aspect. If anyone has good ideas on reducing car accidents or
    predicting earthquakes, say it. They will be adopted if they
    work.

These measures have costs as well as benefits.  They need to be judged
based on both.  We could end traffic accidents (and many other problems)

With the money that the Boston shutdown cost, you could prevent a
substantial number of car accidents through road improvements, and you
could reliably save lives that way.

    As a society, we don't tolerate cop-killers. We band together and come down
    on them like a ton of bricks. Why? We want our police officers to feel safe
    and respected.

This is hard to unpack because it says that "we", i.e. all of us, feel
as you described.

I don't give as much priority as you do to making cops feel safe,
because I am always concerned to support campaigns to enable
protesters, journalists, people in minority groups, and anyone making
videos of cops on the street, to feel safe.  The cops are the main
obstacle.

    We want to live in
    a world where police officers need not fear every shadow, because the
    mistakes they make in fear will lead to innocent casualties. 

I more or less agree with you there, though I suggest that the way to
reduce these innocent casualties is to have fewer SWAT teams.  Outside
of a few large cities, there is hardly ever a need for them, but once
a town has one, it will come up with occasions to use it.

    I consider a voluntary lockdown in attempt to safely capture a wild
    cop-killer armed with bombs and rifles entirely reasonable.

What a leap!  Whether the shutdown of Boston served this or any
purpose is exactly the question.

There have been many manhunts for cop-killers, nearly all of them were
armed and dangerous, and never was there a need to shut down a whole
large city for it.

If you use proprietary software, it denies you control over your
computing which you ought to have.  I hope you will switch to free software,
but if you don't, the direct harm is to you.

Proprietary software development is a harmful and unjust activity, but
I would not suggest shutting down the whole Boston metro area just
to hamper the proprietary software developers in it.

     The effect on Boston's 
    resolve from the capture was quite clear and in my opinion outweighed 
    any inconvenience of not working for one day.

Those words presume that the shutdown was necessary to capture him,
but that's precisely the question we are discussing.

    One important point I think is getting lost in all the careful statistical
    estimation. Our response to violent crime is not simply a question of
    minimizing risk today; it's also the much more complicated question of
    minimizing risk and adverse consequences in the long run, by establishing an
    incentive structure. A better model might be a repeated game.

The way to reduce the incentive for terrorism is (1) to minimize the
damage they do and (2) minimize the public attention they get.
We did pretty well at (1), aside from the shutdown.  However,
in regard to (2), we're doing the exact opposite of what is needed.

In the interests of (2), here's a story that reminds us of the people
who die in the US under what amounts to torture.  By the thousands.
This is what rends my heart.  We are much more likely to meet that
painful fate than a quick death from a bomb.  Do read the comments.

A factory collapsed in Bangladesh.  I later read that 160 workers were

http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/04/24-4

This relates to us because US and European companies have resisted the
application of safety standards (and labour standards) to their
suppliers.  They lobbied for the system of globalization which
encourages accident-prone arrangements like this one.

In other words, this was part of the same broad practice of
business-arranged weak regulation that led to the Texas chemical
explosion and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  It causes tremendous
casualties around the world, and we ought to focus our concerns on
this rather than on much smaller dangers.

I've argued that we should not focus on the Boston bombing to the
point where we distract ourselves from bigger dangers (to our lives,
to our freedom).  But I agree that setting off bombs in a crowd is
inexcusable.  You are trying to cast doubt on that position.

You seem to be arguing in favor of intentionally attacking
noncombattants -- in effect, you reject the principles by which we
conclude that al Qa'ida is doing something bad.  Following your
argument, we would have no basis to disapprove of al Qa'ida, or the
Boston bombers, except that they're opposed to us.

I think it makes sense to make the assassin game more inconspicuous
for a few weeks, for the sake of people who might feel frightened.
There's nothing to be frightened of, but some people can't help it,
so why not be kind to them?

Players could also move the game to a building at the other side of
campus, since people there are likely to be less emotionally impacted.

It would likewise be good to help people in Stata become less
emotionally impacted about this.  For instance, MIT would have done
better not to send messages encouraging people to be strongly
emotionally impacted.  Some people are, but if you're not, that's your
good fortune.

The idea that software should be free is the basic goal of the Free
Software Movement, which many of the people at the meeting support.
We condemn non-free software as unethical, because we believe users
are entitled to certain freedoms and it is wrong to take them away.
(See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.)

Your arguments against the Free Software Movement seem to be based on
the assumption that it is ok for one person to restrict another in any
fashion as long as it is part of a deal.  I believe in unalienable
rights.  For me, your argument is a non-starter.

I cannot be sure that all Free Software supporters share my view of
the ethics.  What we certainly agree on is that we want to use our
computers with free software.  The influence we could exert by
individually choosing among the offered alternatives is too weak to
achieve this goal, so we have organized to apply more pressure to the
manufacturers and developers.

It sounds like you disagree with this goal, and with most of the ideas
of the Free Culture Movement as well.  You are not compelled to
participate if you don't support our aims.





    As for me, I got lucky. After a couple hours of refusing to find the HD, 
    the laptop booted and I copied all my data. I am now installing the OEM 
    version of Windows

How sad.




    My desktop machine broke and so Dell sent me a bunch of parts to try. 
    But none of them fixed the problem. So they sent me a new machine, but 
    it has Vista pre-installed. Yeah, yeah, I know Windows is evil (I'm 
    working on Tablet PC code, so I need Windows).

Windows Vista is much more evil than previous versions.  (See
BadVista.org.)  Perhaps you should complain and insist they send you a
replacement machine with the same Windows version that you had.

I hope that you're not writing software to RUN on Windows.  Each
program written to run on Windows adds to the social inertia that
keeps Windows going.  A year from now, will someone say, "I know
Windows is evil, but I'm using Aaron Adler's code so I need Windows"?




    Whether you use Windows Vista or Windows XP, surely you can agree that 
    the other OS has good aspects, too.

I'm happy to say I use neither of them, so I don't have to agree ;-).
Windows keeps users divided and helpless.

Of course people can have their own opinions over whether it is bad to
keep users divided and helpless.




I am sad to say that the Khan Academy uses a nonfree license for its
educational works.  (He says "open source", but his license for
educational works does not qualify as that either.)  I met with Khan a
few months ago and tried to convince him to change this, but he would
not be convinced.

If you want to work on free educational works, that is very useful.
The two free CC licenses are CC-BY (non-copyleft) and CC-BY-SA (copyleft).
There is also the GNU Free Documentation License, which is good to use
for texts since there are other educational texts under it.

Please don't publish through Khan Academy unless he accepts to use one
of these free license for your work.  If he does accept, that will
achieve a change for the better in the Khan Academy.  Otherwise, it is
better to publish your works as free in some other place.  He will
still be able to use them, but he won't get to make them nonfree.

Please pass the word if you see that anouncement made elsewhere.

    According to the Khan Academy Site, it is licensed under "CC-BY-NC-SA". 
    In other words, you can copy/adapt the work (CC), but must attribute 
    origin (BY) and cannot change the license terms (SA) and cannot use for 
    commercial purposes (NC).  The "non-freeness" to which rms is referring 
    is only the "NC" restriction forbidding commercial use.

That's right.  If a work disallows commercial use, it is not free.
This is why MIT Open Courseware is nonfree.

In Khan's interpretation, what MIT does is "commercial use"
and not allowed.

    Perhaps you can give a few arguments for why one should not, in particular,
    restrict commercial use?

We're talking about educational works, which are works meant for use
to do a practical job (learning or teaching).  Works that people must
be free to modify -- and in this case, they are free to modify.

As long as commercial use of these works is important for society,
those works that are excluded from commercial distribution are not
fully available for society to use.  That hampers their usefulness.
For instance, if a company distributes a large collection of
educational works, the Khan Academy works would have to be omitted.

As people make modified versions of modified versions of these works,
the obstacles to commercial use of any of them will mount up.  For
instance, suppose you were to make a modified version of one of those
Khan Academy works.  Anyone wanting to use that commercially would
have to get permission from you AND from Khan.

Khan says that distribution to students at MIT (or any school) is
commercial use.  So if a teacher at MIT wanted to distribute copies to
her students, she would have to ask you AND Khan.

Why accept this sort of limitation?

    Note that this is unlikely to have the desired effect unless Congress
    actually enacts legislation to say so -- and that's unlikely given the
    fact that a new patent law was just enacted.

That is true if we judge the petition as an attempt to convince Obama
to take a specific step.  I agree that is unlikely, but the petition
could be very useful nonetheless.  Signing provides an opportunity to
show the strength of opposition to software patents.

That can help the cause in the long term, even if we don't know
precisely how it will have an effect.  Since it only takes a minute to
sign, why hesitate?

    Is having a software update mechanism (a "backdoor", using your words)
    non-Free?

They are two separate issues, but related.

Basically, Chrome is non-free because its source code is not
available.  The experts I asked told me that Chrome does not
correspond to the source code released as Chromium.  Chromium is free
software. but Chrome is not.

Based on what you've said, the logo of Chrome is another problem.
Indeed, the logo of Firefox makes it nonfree.

This kind problem is not hard to fix: just change the name and logo.
But we need to DO that -- just knowing we COULD do it is not enough.
That's why, in the Free World, we don't use Firefox, but rather
IceWeasel, IceCat, and maybe other modified versions.  If Chrome had
only this problem, we would fix it this way too.

Non-free add-ons such as Flash Player are included in the Chrome
distribution, and that also makes it non-free.

These issues make Chrome non-free, back door or no back door.
However, because it is non-free, it can contain malicious features
such as back doors, that users can't remove.

Malicious features are known in the most widely used non-free
programs.  There are features that spy on users, features that
restrict them (DRM), and back doors.  Chrome has its own back door,
and Chrome includes Flash Player which has surveillance and restricion
features.  It follows that Chrome includes all three kinds.

Believing a bullshitter like Trump is a sign of someone who hasn't
got a lick of sense.  He may have real problems, but he can't begin
to tell a serious solution from a charlatan.

I'm using a distinction between lying and bullshitting.  A lie tries
to pass for truth.  Bullshit rejects the idea of truth.

Clinton was not a bullshitter.  She took a position and stuck to it.
I suspected and still suspect that parts of her position were lies,
but that's a different thing from bullshitting.

Trump, by contrast, overtly rejected the idea of rational consistency
and blatantly changed his mind every day.  Nothing he said was a
serious position.

  > It's unlike you to beg the question and use ad hominem at the same time.

You've got the definition of "ad hominem" wrong.  Here's an ad hominem
attack: "X must be wrong because the person who said it is a fool."
That's logically invalid reasoning.

My criticism is, "Whoever said X must be a fool because X is so
blatantly wrong."  That's logicall valid reasoning.

I've already addressed the other point by explaining the distinction
between bullshitting and lying.  To tell truth from falsehood is
sometimes difficult when the falsehood is designed to pass for truth.
However, it's easy to recognize a bullshitter by the frequent
self-contradiction.

I got this message from the ACLU:

    Police departments across the nation are increasingly adopting
    advanced surveillance technologies once used only by the most
    sophisticated militaries. Too often, police get those tools but keep
    the public totally in the dark?about the acquisitions, the policies
    and the way the tools are used.

    Now, Cambridge residents have a chance to require a robust public and
    transparent process before your police can acquire drones, cell phone
    spying tools or other surveillance devices. An ordinance to be
    introduced by Mayor Denise Simmons and endorsed by civil liberties,
    civil rights and human rights groups will require the Cambridge Police
    to be frank with the public about its plans to buy surveillance
    technologies, receive public approval before buying them and regularly
    report to the community about how they're used.

    Join us on Monday, November 21 at 5:30PM at Cambridge City Hall.

You can call City Hall and see how to sign up by phone
to speak in the meeting.

Here are some issues I would raise if I could go.

    The message talks about "buying" surveillance technology.
    But there are other ways the thug department could get it, or the use
    of it.  At least these:

    * The department could rent it or subscribe to it.
    * The US government could give it to the department,
       as it often gives armored vehicles and such.
    * A billionaire could donate it (or the use of it).
    * A company could donate it (or the use of it).

    There might be others I have not thought of.

If the ordinance indeed applies only to purchase of technology, I
suggest that the ordinance be amended to clearly cover all those
other avenues.

It says they are fools because they believe something that everyone should
recognize as wrong.

The proposed ordinance is a step in the right direction, but if it
really covers only "buying" surveillance technology then it has a big
loophole.  It needs to cover these channels of acquisition, in
addition to purchase.

* Renting the use of surveillance technology.
* Accepting gifts of surveillance technology, or its use.

Since I am out of town, I can't go on Monday to propose this.
I hope some of you will do so.

I agree.

That's a different matter.  Since I recognize that Trump is

what they need.

Sanders would have really tried, with a chance of success.

I have not even got a copy of it.  Given the short time, I decided it
was better to respond ASAP to raise the issues rather than wait to get
a copy and then wait for time to read it.

You're saying, "Don't warn us of a possible danger unless you know
whether it is actual."  I disagree with that general claim.

In theory, I could have done a thorough study on my own.  But that's
not feasible for me.  The best thing for me to do was what I did.

I said "if" here

to indicate that this was a possible problem, not a verified problem.

  > Your "if" is false. It does not cover only "buying."

That's good news.  I'm glad that the issue has been addressed.

Overall I agree with your message, but there is one subpoint where
in passing it concedes to Republicans something they don't deserve.

  > 2) One party is about to control all three branches of government.  That's
  > cool -- GOP should get their agenda pushed they earned it

The Republican party controlls the House of Representatives due to
gerrymandering.  In fact, Democratic candidates got a lot more votes
in total than Republican candidates did.

This is not earning, this is cheating.

I have collected some empty charlie cards; they are on a small ledge
just outside my office door, room 32-381.  Please come and take one if
you need one.

When your current card becomes empty, how about leaving it on that ledge
or sliding it under my door, and taking another card?

I put a few post-its on the ledge saying "I left a charlie card on the
ledge".  If you leave a card there, please slide a post-it under the
door; that way I will know people are contributing cards.

The charlie card can be scanned anywhere, and the system has been
cracked.  For your privacy and safety, keep the card in aluminum foil
whenever it's not in use, and put money in only with cash.

    Someone in my area has misplaced his Kindle reader.

The name "Kindle" describes what that device threatens to do to our
books.  It is designed so as to put an end to the practice of lending
books to your friends.

The accidental loss of the device could, counterintuitively, be an
opportunity for him to stop using that device.  This would remove an
obstacle to the lending of books between people in the group, and thus
improve its social cohesiveness and friendliness.

Good idea.  Here's another idea: MIT could go on record as a whole.

It would be important to post a list of provisions in those laws that
are condemned.  The proponents are talking about removing a little
from it, and then they might say "It's a different bill now, so all
those opponents never said anythhing against it."

Senator Brown said he will vote against SOPA, but Kerry has not.

in Massachusetts, please phone Kerry's office.  (617) 565-8519.

Also, please spread the word to people you know who live
in other states.  Both of California's senators are supporters
of SOPA and they need to hear from a lot more angry constituents.

It is definitely more effective to phone an elected official than to
send an email.  A snail letter might be even more effective, because
sending it is more work, and that work impresses the officials.

But there is no time for snail letters to reach senators before the

    I like how you think not using Facebook is more important than supporting
    an initiative that helps international development projects... 

Facebook is an international parasitism project.

I don't know the details of the development projects
so I won't try to  estimate how much good any of them might do.
But it is clear they could have done this in some
other way, instead of Facebook.  In other words, the question
of comparing the good of these projects against the harm of Facebook
arises because someone made an snap choice.

If people involved now complain and say, politely, "I'm staying
away from Facebook", next time they will think about the question
and they will do it in some other way.

    Here's a quick thought experiment: let's say there's some super promising
    FSF-approved Facebook replacement and they need to grow their numbers...
    how would you suggest they go about doing this?

There are many ethical ways to inform people.  (I am sure you know of
many of them yourself.)  Thus, your question is based on an
exaggerated false premise.

						    Oh and you obviously can't
    use Facebook because it's evil, right?

What I say about Facebook is that it systematically mistreats its
users, with the specifics in stallman.org/facebook.html.

A plan to replace Facebook, if it says that Facebook is unethical and
therefore needs to be rejected, must not use Facebook itself, because
using it would be hypocritical.

    That said, you raised an important question... *why would Intel only allow
    people to vote on Facebook?* Surely that's not fair! Well. It sort of is.
    First of all, Facebook is providing Intel a service: a platform that makes
    it easy to build apps.

Is that good or bad?  Those apps will require their users to submit to
Facebook's mistreatment.  I think that makes the world a worse place.
And I certainly won't use them myself.

     More importantly, though, Facebook has built a
    network of >800 million active users. So that means *there's a ton of
    potential to spread good messages to people who wouldn't have seen them
    otherwise*

This is called the "network effect".   Many people use Facebook and they
exert a pull on others to use Facebook.

The pull is so strong that many people will use Facebook for that
reason even when they know it is mistreating them.  That means we need
to organize to pull in the other direction.

Is that a good thing or a bad one?  If those apps require their users
to use Facebook, I think they exacerbate the problem.

    network of >800 million active users. So that means *there's a ton of
    potential to spread good messages to people who wouldn't have seen them
    otherwise*

This is called the "network effect".  Many people use Facebook, and
they attract others to use Facebook.

Those who use Facebook use it for purposes of their own.  Sometimes
those purposes are good.  Usually, they are not particularly bad.
However, doing those things via Facebook causes harm as a byproduct,
because this is what gives Facebook the pull that enables it to get
away with mistreating its users.

Instead of trying to "leverage Facebook for good", let's do our good
work with other methods.

    Richard, I understand that the FSF is working to help the world. But there
    are other ways of helping the world too -- *not everything that goes
    against the FSF's principles should be discounted as "evil."

A non-free program is an injustice, and we should never tolerate one.
However, Facebook is a service, not a program, and I think it can be
mostly used via free software.

My main objections to Facebook are about other things.  There are many
ethical issues in life, and Facebook is on the wrong side of several
of them.  I won't list them all here; see stallman.org/facebook.html.

    build applications in HTML5, enabling all web developers to write Windows 8
    apps with minimal learning curve. Now does Microsoft still prefer people
    use .NET? Yes, absolutely. But they know HTML5 isn't going away so they've
    worked it into their strategy.

Microsoft's objection to HTML5 was not a matter of principle, so it
had no reason to fight HTML5 to the bitter end.  I don't say push
against the current unceasingly when it is just a matter of
preferences.  I do it when the current is sweeping people to something
very bad.

preaches.  To use Facebook in that activity would be hypocritical.

Fortunately there are many other ways to spread the word.  For
instance, the project can make its own web site, or use wordpress.
Facebook has not reached the point where anyone is compelled to use
it.  It is one system among many.

    *And you made your
    choice quite clear when you decided to divert attention away from the topic
    at hand

When you ask people to do something, you make it proper to discuss
whether that something is good or bad.

    That being said, I completely agree that Richard's efforts would be a lot
    more successful if he would have reasonable alternatives for the products
    or services that he asks us not to use. I hope he will take this into
    account as he organizes FSF's efforts.

There are lots of things it would be good if we had.  Most of our work
is done by volunteers.  There are a number of free software
distributed social networking projects -- would you like to help one
of them?

    As Richard admitted, *HE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING AT THE PROJECTS*.

I am talking about Facebook.  Those projects are not the issue.

    What he could have said instead was "go ahead and use Facebook to vote, but
    can you also keep in mind that Facebook is evil yadda yadda and write an
    email to abc at intel.com and tell them you don't like Facebook."

I stated my views: Facebook mistreats its users, so people should not
urge or lead others to use Facebook.  I will not encourage people to
do something that is bad for them and others.

We need to make opposition to Facebook stronger, not weaker.  Gentle
opposition such as you suggest will not even be noticed as opposition
by a corporation.  Remember, large corporations have no human
feelings.  They are psychopaths by design.

What you say to corporations:

   Do business with corporation X, but keep in mind
   the ways it mistreats you.

What corporations hear:

   Do business with corporation X.

You have to say "Bad corporation!" and rub the corporation's nose in
its mess.  That tends to work -- if it enough people do it.

If a few people decline to use Facebook, they won't change Facebook,
but at least they will protect themselves.

    One of the commentators mentioned that for equal aptitude of the
    student, business/finance pays an order of magnitude better than
    engineering.

This reflects the deregulation of the banks and financial sector,
which is also responsible for the housing bubble and the subsequent
downturn, and the massive fraudulent foreclosures.  It also reflects
the enormous income disparities in the US between executives and workers.

Both of these desperately need to be corrected.

What is the practical effect of Elsevier's policy on scientists at
MIT?  And how does it differ from other major journal publishers
(excluding those that practice redistributable publication and public access)?

    How much of a problem would that be for our lab members, if they felt
    they shouldn't publish in Elsevier journals?

It is impossible to tell, because that depends on us.

If lots of scientists boycott Elsevier, Elsevier will lose.  The more
they do it, the faster Elsevier will give up, and the less inconvenience
they will experience.

But if scientists worry "will I get hurt", and they don't boycott
Elsevier, the Elsevier will get away with its new nastiness (and its
old nastiness too).

United and firm we stand, divided and hesitant we fall.

The issue at hand is whether authors can post their own articles.
This is not an economic issue.

Dr. Lehr criticized http://thecostofknowledge.com/ in economic terms.
That is understandable since the site itself suggests that
perspective.  Two of the criticisms in http://thecostofknowledge.com/
refer to mere price, rather than the issue at hand.

Elsevier supports unjust laws which are important issues, but SOPA and
PIPA are not directly related to this issue.  Many SOPA supporters
have been boycotted (including GoDaddy.com).  And it is not clear that
we can gain much effect against those laws by boycotting Elsevier.
(GoDaddy.com, by contrast, seems to have been a very useful target.)
Only the Research Works Act relates directly to this issue.

This is battle is part of the long struggle to defeat the journal
publishers' stranglehold over dissemination of scholarly writing.
(See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/push-copyright-aside.html.)  MIT's
"open access" policy was move in this struggle, not aimed at hurting
anyone but simply at making knowledge accessible.  Elsevier has
responded with a counterattack that is an evident powerplay.

Elsevier is one among many publishers that bottle up scholarly
writing, acting as parasites.  They all deserve our opppsition because
science needs to make them all stop what they are doing.  It does not
follow that we should treat them all the same!

A government has to treat citizens according to fair and uniform
rules, because it has special power over them.  We have no special
power over publishers, so we have no such obligation.  Publishers will
treat us differently if that enables them to defeat us, and we should
not hesitate to treat publishers differently in order to win.

Boycott is a weapon -- a weapon of the many, individually weak,
against the powerful few.  We should wield this weapon so as to win.
We should boycott one company at a time.

This need not be the company that is objectively the nastiest (though
it would not surprise me if Elsevier were the nastiest).  We should
choose the target that gives us the best chance to win.

But what determines that?  It is not just a matter of the general
facts about that target.  The current situation also figures in.  With
people boycotting Elsevier already for other reasons, this is a
special opportunity.  Let's take advantage of it!

Neil van Dyke said

      Elsevier has 
    little power now, other than what a field chooses to give it.

The point is to organize the complacent scientists to take the
long view and stop giving Elsevier this power.  Then move on
and tackle the other publishers.

The meaning of "open access" has been weakened so that it is no longer
the proper goal.  The Budapest Declaration defined it in terms of two
criteria:

1. The publication site should allow access by anyone.

2. Everyone should be allowed to redistribute exact copies
of the articles.

The second criterion is stronger.  In practice, it implies the first:
if everyone has the freedom to redistribute copies, university
libraries will mirror all the articles, making them accessible to
everyone.

I signed the Budapest Declaration because it was correct in substance,
putting aside my misgivings about the name "open access" which
emphasizes the weaker first criterion.  My misgivings proved correct:
advocates of open access subsequently dropped the second criterion.
For instance, the NIH's open access policy only includes the first
criterion.

In effect, the bad name converted the good substance.  "Open access",
as defined today, is an inadequate goal.

Today we should forget the term "open access journals", and talk about
"redistributable journals" -- which means the same thing "open access"
meant 10 years ago.

    I've been trying to stay out of this, but not citing articles in 
    Elsevier journals is a slippery slope.  Surely, intellectual honesty 
    demands that one gives credit where credit is due.

These two goals can be reconciled.  Don't be quick to give up.

Suppose A and B first published a result or method, using an Elsevier
journal.  If it is important, there is probably some other description
of it, P, in a non-Elsevier publication.  You can attribute it to A
and B, cite P for people to learn it from, and explain why.

Other variations can be designed.  Intellectual honesty cannot require
people to support an injustice.

There is a difference between citing a person and her work, and citing
a particular paper in which that work was published.  Intellectual
honesty calls for the former but not the latter.  Given that
Elsevier's power comes from others' citing the papers it publishes,
every citation of such a paper feeds Elsevier's power.  It behooves us
not to cite those papers -- at least not in a way that
citation-counting systems will recognize.

This is how we will convince researchers who put their own careers
above the well-being of science not to publish in Elsevier journals.
We will give them honest credit for their work, but do so in ways that
don't support Elsevier.

    As for Elsevier, if I were an editor of an Elsevier
    journal, I'd seriously question whether the scholarly reputation of my
    journal was likely to be damaged by the publisher's propensity
    for academic dishonesty scandals:

      http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/06/23/elsevier

The Elsevier journals do not seem to be dying yet.
Apparently many scholars are not as aware of these as you are.

Thus, rather than wait for them to notice these facts and draw
your conclusions, we might try actively to educate them.

Opposing that bill and opposing Elsevier go hand in hand.
I am sure Elsevier is spending money to promote that bill.
Maybe Elsevier has endorsed the bill; maybe it can be shown
that Elsevier donated to the congresscritters proposing it.
Either one would provide another reason to denounce Elsevier.

I wonder whether the ACM and IEEE support the bill too.
I don't know, but it seems plausible to me.
Members of these organizations might ask the leadership,
and call on the organizations to formally oppose this bill.

    Last I checked the loop of "too dark, turn on lights, oh look it's
    bright enough, I'll turn off the lights" was not a solved
    problem.

If the question is, "Do we have sunlight now?", maybe it calls for
directional light sensors aimed at the windows.  Alternatively, it
would be easy enough to determine when dawn and dusk are given the
date.

However, that is the philosophically easy part of the problem.
What to do with that info is harder.

What exactly should be the criterion for turning lights on?  It would
be a shame to have sensors turn on the lights all night when nobody is
around, just because it is dark out.  Meanwhile, people don't
generally turn ON the lights when sunlight makes the area bright
enough.

We could use motion sensors as found in the offices.  Because the
metal-halogen lamps take longer to turn on, the sensors should wait
somewhat longer before turning them off.  Maybe 20 minutes.  And they
should know about the delay requirement before turning them on again.

The announcement of the Friday event does an injustice to Marvin
Minsky:

    deceased AI “pioneer” Marvin Minsky (who is accused of assaulting
    one of Epstein’s victims [2])

The injustice is in the word "assaulting".  The term "sexual assault"
is so vague and slippery that it facilitates accusation inflation:
taking claims that someone did X and leading people to think of it as
Y, which is much worse than X.

The accusation quoted is a clear example of inflation.  The reference
reports the claim that Minsky had sex with one of Epstein's harem.
(See https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed.)
Let's presume that was true (I see no reason to disbelieve it).

The word "assaulting" presumes that he applied force or violence, in
some unspecified way, but the article itself says no such thing.
Only that they had sex.

We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that
she presented herself to him as entirely willing.  Assuming she was
being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her
to conceal that from most of his associates.

I've concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it
is absolutely wrong to use the term "sexual assault" in an accusation.

Whatever conduct you want to criticize, you should describe it with a
specific term that avoids moral vagueness about the nature of the
criticism.

  > Giuffre was 17 at the time; this makes it ___rape___ in the Virgin Islands.

Does it really?  I think it is morally absurd to define "rape" in a
way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or
whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.

I think the existence of a dispute about that supports my point that
the term "sexual assault" is slippery, so we ought to use more
concrete terms when accusing anyone.

  > The Verge article includes the deposition snippet, which is not
  > ambiguous at all: Giuffre directly says she was forced to have sex
  > with Minsky.

I don't see any quotation from the depostion in the article, but it
says, "Giuffre says she was directed to have sex with Minsky."  Given
the circumstances, that implies she was coerced by Epstein into doing
so.

The article I know of, and have a copy of, is
https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed.
Are you talking of some other Verge article?  If so, would you like to
tell me its URL?

  > Let’s stop grasping at straws to defend our friends, and instead
  > listen to the women who were harmed.

We can listen only to what is said to us.

All I know she said about Minsky is that Epstein directed her to have
sex with Minsky.  That does not say whether Minsky knew that she was
coerced.  It does not report what each said and did during their
sexual encounter.  We can imagine various scenarios.

We know that Giuffre was being coerced into sex -- by Epstein.  She
was being harmed.  But the details do affect whether, and to what
extent, Minsky was responsible for that.

Looking through the article again carefully, I found a link that
reportedly points to the deposition itself.  I visited that URL and
got a blank window.  It is on Google Drive, which demands running
nonfree software in order to see it.  See
https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html.

Would you (not anyone else!) like to email me a copy of the part that
pertains to Minsky?  I say "not anyone else" to avoid getting 20
copies.

After looking at what Gregory Benford wrote, and the analysis of

I think you are treating laws as an unquestionable moral authority.

not on the decisions of legislatures.  Empathy and moral thought

I want to respond to the misleading media coverage of messages I
posted about Marvin Minsky's association with Jeffrey Epstein.  The
coverage totally mischaracterised my statements.

Headlines say that I defended Epstein.  Nothing could be further from
the truth.  I've called him a "serial rapist", and said he deserved to
be imprisoned.  But many people now believe I defended him -- and
other inaccurate claims -- and feel a real hurt because of what they
believe I said.

I'm sorry for that hurt.  I wish I could have prevented the

Your position is simple and consistent: if something is illegal then
it is wrong.  I disagree with you at that basic level.  I do not
consider that laws dictate what is right and wrong.  I think we have
to do our own thinking about each moral question.

to hand out at the start of this talk?

I very much wish I could do it myself, but I will be out of town.

This is not a protest against the talk -- I don't know what their
stance will be -- but rather a way of bringing to people's attention
the to the danger of massive surveillance, both the commercial part
and the state part, requires strong measures.

Can we recover a sense of privacy in public spaces such as social media? Russia trolls misrepresent their identity. Cambridge Analytica abuses research data to target political ads and propaganda.  Facebook belatedly realizes that perhaps they should have been more careful. We’ll look at legal and technical strategies that can restore a real sense of privacy in the increasingly public and global online environments where we live.

That is true, but I think it's a detail without important
consequences.  My point is that IceCat blocks those surveillance
methods.

IceCat is better than the Tor Browser for blocking other surveillance
because it blocks a lot of Javascript surveillance.  (Eventually we
will make IceCat block all the JS primitives that are crucial for
fingerprinting.)

I think that startpage does a better search than duckduckgo
while still being usable via tor.

  > Using IceCat instead of the Tor Browser makes it easier to track you
  > since your browser's fingerprint is different from everyone else's.

There are some errors in that claim.

1. "Everyone else" is an exaggeration.
You won't be the only person who turns off Javascript.

2. A web site can detect that you turn off Javascript, IF the
developers bother to implement a check for that.  While few
people do so, I expect they won't bother.

Calling that datum part of the "fingerprint" is misleading, I think.
The fingerprint, properly speaking, is what the Javascript _computes_.
However, for sake of discussion, let's call it part of the
fingerprint for now.

3. Turning off Javascript means, in effect, that most of your
fingerprint is blank, and the rest is what IceCat is set up to send.
Thus, these users are clearly different from most users, but hard to
distinguish one from another.

4. If more people start blocking Javascript, the pool of
indistinguishable users will grow.

  > The Tor FAQ says:

  > "In short, using any browser besides Tor Browser with Tor is a
  > really bad idea."

Their statement is based on specific assumptions that apply only to
some people.  They assume that you are hiding from your government
because it is likely to kill or imprison you if it finds you.  In such
a case, avoiding being located takes priority over everything else.
If you are in that situation, by all means follow their advice.

My situation is not like that.  (Is yours?)

For me, blocking nonfree software is the highest priority, and
disguising my location via Tor is second priority.  For this
combination of goals, turning off Javascript is best.

That URL leads to Eventbrite.  Thus, this CSAIL-sponsored activity
requires attendees to run a nonfree program, and gives a business
personal information about each participant.

Each of these does wrong to people who participate -- and to those

way.

CSAIL should adopt the rule not to use Eventbrite, and allow people to

    Github's wiki and web hosting (Pages) features are also entirely
    in Git and are self-hostable and their implementations' open

Are they free software?

The sharp difference between free software and open source is at the
level of philosophy, but they are not quite coextensive at the
practical level.

    Yes, I know, and I specifically meant that they fulfill all the
    FSF standards:

I am glad you were thinking of us, but what you said was something
else.  Our criteria are for free software.  "Open source" refers to a
different set of criteria.

    all of this stuff is MIT licensed and has been from the day they
    launched it.

The term "MIT license" is not entirely unambiguous, since it refers to
two slightly different licenses.  They are both pushover licenses,
which is not the best choice, but they are free licenses.

So it looks like these programs are free software.  That is good.

Thanks.

It's misleading to speak of an "IP-knowledgeable" person, unless you
mean "Internet Protocol", because "intellectual property" is a bogus
concept.

The first intellectual misstep is to take various disparate laws,
copyright being one of them, and make a label, "intellectual property
laws", to talk about them as a generalization.  (It's a mistake to do
that, since their gross differences are more important than their tiny
similarities.)  The second misstep is to formulate an abstract "thing"
that these laws are "about".  That "thing" doesn't relate to reality.

Likewise, it is misleading to describe a putative copyright
infringement as an "IP violation".

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html.


I think only a lawyer can answer your question.  However, based on
what I've seen, this looks like a form of "copyright trolling".  The
idea is that your friend will find it cheaper to pay Getty than to pay
a lawyer to find out whether Getty is bluffing.  I think that Getty
won't pay the costs of suing over such a small matter, and figures,
"Let's send him a few letters -- it will cost us a few dollars and we
have a 10% chance of scaring him into paying $1200."  However, IANAL.

The EFF might be able to give some advice, or other organizations
that have tried to fight copyright trolls.

I know of a way to push back: through publicity.  He should post to
show what Getty has done, and ask whether Getty is a copyright troll
that tries to exploit the weak.

I hope he will take care to avoid statements that would grant any
moral legitimacy to Getty's use of copyright, like "If only they
pushed one cm less, I would not criticize it."  They would be
self-undermining.

It would be useful to search first for any existing campaign against
Getty, for this or something else.  It could be useful to work with
such a campaign if it exists.


Meanwhile, don't embed Getty images in web pages -- that is bad for
your visitors' privacy.  It functions like a Facebook Like button,
enabling Getty to snoop on visitors to your page.

It looks like your friend used that image for no reason except to make
the page cute.  Getty surely hopes that millions of pages will extend
its surveillance reach for such insignificant motives.

The GNU browser IceCat blocks all embedded images, to protect privacy.

    Even if it was a mistake it is still an infringement. I don't know
    where the amount of the fee is decided. I would send them a letter
    and $200 and see what happens.

They will think, "We got $200 so easily; surely we can get $1000 more
by continuing to sound menacing."

    * I agree with rms that IP isn't really property, but a set of privileges
    using the mechanisms of property in an attempt to promote the progress of
    science and useful arts, by securing for *limited* times to authors and
    inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.

That's the Constitution's statement of what copyright law and patent
law are for -- but the statement becomes invalid when extended to
"IP", because "IP" includes other unrelated laws.  That statement does
not pertain to trademark law, trade secret law, or publicity rights.

Any time you use the term "IP" you are almost certain to make a
mistake.  Even law professors who know about all these laws sometimes
get lured into errors by it.  It generalizes every statement too far.

The term sheds no light on anything, and the only way to prevent
it from doing harm is not to use it.

    Not having studied the issue extensively, I disagree with both rms and
    current law about how this ought be implemented.

Perhaps we do disagree, but it's also possible that you've got the
wrong idea about where I stand.  The reason I think that may be so is
that I don't have any views about "this" (being copyright and patent
lumped together).  I have a position on copyright law, and a different
position on patent law.

For patent law, see
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/limit-patent-effect.html and
http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/llj/pdfs/45_1_stallman.pdf.

    Isn't it just easier to double check that you are not infringing on 
    someone else's IP instead of tempting fate for patent trolls?

This shows how the term "IP" causes confusion.  Patent law and
copyright law are totally different; to lump them together makes
misunderstanding almost inevitable.

As someone else said, it is unfeasible in practice to tell what might
infringe some patent.  Any complex system probably infringes hundreds
of patents.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/software-literary-patents.html.

It is fairly clear how to avoid copyright infringement, aside from the
substantial gray areas such as how far fair use extends.  (For most
activities, they don't come into play.)  However, that doesn't help
the person whose hired web developer made a mistake.

That is a small misunderstanding -- he didn't say it was licensed by
MIT.  There are some lax, permissive free software licenses that are
often called "the MIT license".  He meant that Lightbox is released,
by its developers, under one of those licenses.  Although those
licenses are weak, they are free, so the Lightbox code is free.

That's a good thing (though it would be clearer not to call these
licenses "the MIT license").  I hope that the Lightbox code carries
its license in a way LibreJS can recognize (for this issue, see
http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html).

He also said that it can potentially work with Javascript disabled,
which is good.

If you tell me the URL of your site, I will try it with Javascript
disabled, and with LibreJS functioning, and tell you what I see.

Using Eventbrite for registration for the CSAIL Spring Social (or for
anything) has two bad consequences:

* It gives a company information about each of the attendees.
CSAIL should not require people to give personal data to a company
to participate in its activities.

* It means they have to run a nonfree program in order to sign up.  A
nonfree program means a program that doesn't respect its users'
freedom (see http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html and
http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html).

For the sake of your own freedom, it is a bad idea to run any nonfree
program, and CSAIL certainly shouldn't ask anyone to do so.

Would you please arrange a way to register for the Spring Social
without using Eventbrite or any other company?  I expect the CSAIL
sysadmins already know how to do this and could set it up in 10
minutes, but if they don't already know, the Free Software Foundation
can do it.

Everyone else, if you want to go to the Spring Social, I suggest that
you send Valerie Stephens email about it, rather than connecting to
Eventbrite.

Good morning once again!

I was informed that some people are having difficulty accessing the 
registration page for the 2016 CSAIL Spring Social. I apologize about 
the inconvenience.

As a result, please find below an updated registration link for the 2016 
CSAIL Spring Social:

The invitation you forwarded had a grave error.  Here's the corrected
text: please use this instead.

*From: *Joichi Ito <joi at media.mit.edu>
*Subject: **TALK: 03-20-2016 Public Dialogue on DRM and the Future of
the Web *
*Date: *March 18, 2016 at 6:16:45 AM EDT
*To: *ml-all <ml-all at media.mit.edu <mailto:ml-all at media.mit.edu>>

TALK: 03-20-2016 Public Dialogue on DRM and the Future of the Web

Speakers: Joi Ito (MIT Media Lab), Richard Stallman (FSF), Danny O'Brien
(EFF)
Moderator: Harry Halpin (W3C)

Date: Sunday, March 20, 2016
Time: March 20th  8:00 PM to 9:30 PM
Place: 6th Floor of Media Lab

Will the future of the Web include "Digital Restrictions Management"? The
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the MIT-based international standards
body in charge of "bringing the Web to its full potential" is in process
of deciding if they should continue their work on Encrypted Media
Extensions (EME). The recommendation of EME by W3C would standardize the
use of Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) across browsers. The Free
Software Foundation (FSF) has petitioned W3C to stop all work on EME and
DRM-related technologies. The W3C will consider adopting a DRM
non-aggression covenant drafted by the Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF) at its Advisory Committee meeting at MIT next week.

This is an open invitation for genuine person-to-person dialogue with
people from MIT, FSF, EFF, and W3C about DRM on the Web (and any other
topics of importance to the Web).

Hosted by the Media Lab. Pizza will be provided. Open to the public.

This is a complex philosophical question -- and we don't need to
answer it.  All we need _for this_ is to identify at least a few
charities that are good enough.  Then the hard part is to redirect
that campaign to one or more of those better charities.

Even that hard part is a lot easier than reaching an agreement on the
deep philosophical question.

CSAIL is now "allied" with a "big data" company that pushes face
recognition into everyday life.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/facial-recognition-china-beer-festival

I wonder, does that camera record a customer's face only when the
customer asks to pay that way?  Or does it record every customer's
face?  The first one is bad (leading people into accepting pervasive
face recognition); the second is worse.

I see nothing wrong in accepting donations from that company, as long
they are purely donations and don't entail doing anything for the
company in return.  But calling it an "ally" is just that: it praises
and legitimizes that company.

I don't think CSAIL should offer Ali-pay an Ali-buy.

I didn't know that; I agree it is good to have some unrestricted
hackathons.

However, that's a different issue from the one I raised:
whether CSAIL should promote a hackathon designed specifically to
lead people towards work on military projects.

I later learned that the event is not really a hackathon.
It seems to be an occasion for the military to show students
how cool military technology is, so that some of them will
want to work on military technology.

In theory, US military technology could be used for purposes
such as defending the US from attack.  In practice, the US military
is so powerful that attack is unlikely, and its main use is for
turning other countries into ruins. 

See
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/01/disaster-texas-america-britain-yemen for more about that.

You've stated HackMIT's criteria for judging projects.  But they don't
include any ethical criteria.  I think one is needed.

Would you please insist that projects, to get the support of the
hackathon, be released as free software?  That is, if they turn out
to be usable.

Free software is a matter of freedom, not price. 
See https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.
Nearly all programs that are "open source" are also free software, but
there are a few exceptions whose licenses are too restrictive for us;
see https://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html.

I agree that hackathons should consider other ethical questions _as
well_.  However, free software is a crucial requirement, because hackathons
represent community support for a project, and projects must share
with the community to deserve the community's support.

There are several fallacies here -- including recklessly falsifying my
ethical views and attacking the resulting straw man.  But the
principal fallacy is that your example is nothing like the issue at
hand.  You have changed the subject.

The issue here is about whether and when to give community support
to _development_ of some software.  It's not about whether to use
software that already exists.

If someone has an project for software for a defibrillator, and wants
the hackathon's support for it, the hackathon should say, "Make it
free software if you want our support."  (That won't stop the develpoer
from selling defibrillators with that free software.)

  > Encourage participants to try to see around corners.

It is interesting to try to make such forecasts, but we won't often
succeed.

However, that's a change of subject.

we can recognize wrongs we have seen many times for decades, such as
nonfree software.  Nonfree software is the base for various other
common injustices, see https://gnu.org/malware/, and will surely be
the base for more of them in the future.  Let's help avoid it.

A nofree project in a hackathon says, "I won't share with you
but donate your support to me anyway."  The hackathon should
say, "We will help you if you share with us."

Hackathons are organized activities, organized to provide several
kinds of support to chosen projects.  Recruiting mentors is part of
this organized activity.  I call on the organizers of hackathons to
adopt a policy of giving their organized help only to free software
projects.

As for individuals that, on their own, choose projects to help, I urge
them to adopt the same policy -- but that is not a hackathon.

I've published an article about hackathons and free software; see
https://gnu.org/philosophy/hackathons.html.  I would like to print
copies and distribute them at HackMIT -- not as a protest, but as
a request and petition for future events.

Alas, I can't do it myself.  I won't be in town on Sep 16 and 17 when
the event occurs.  Would someone like to print and distribute them?

Reportedly 1000 people may participate, but even 100 copies would do
some good.  200 copies would do more good.  There is probably no need
for more than 500 copies.

What they are saying is neither of those.  Rather, that the social and
work pressure on them to be useds of Facebook is too hard for them to
resist.

Some people value freedom so much that they will make sacrifices for
it.  We consider them heroic in proportion to the size of those
sacrifices.  It is good that there are heroes; however, a social
system under which such sacrifice is the only way to avoid being
mistreated is a bad system.

Facebook does not offer a way for useds to amend the terms.

Many sites say they may change the terms at any time
without even asking the users/useds whether they accept the changed terms.
Is Facebook one of them?

I mentioned people who "accept" web site terms because the are
resigned to being mistreated by the site.  Pieri vilifies them,
in effect blaming them for surrendering.

These people are surrendering to pressure.  They have seen the social,
family or workplace punishment for saying no to Facebook, and they
don't have the strength to take that, so they must go along.

Once they decide to surrender, they don't need to know the precise
rules.  Seeing those rules would not tell them the practical
consequences anyway (those will depend on future circumstances).
Their decision not to spend time reading the rules is rational since
knowing won't change the outcome.

The pressure they are surrendering to comes directly from various
people and companies, but it is part of a system set up intentionally
by Facebook.  Facebook staff are constantly investigating how to make
this system stronger.  Just yesterday today I learned that Facebook
recenly limited access to organizations' pages, so that only useds of
Facebook can see them.  Those organizations have been lured into
posting information on Facebook, so that Facebook can now use them
as pressure for individuals to click "I agree".

Facebook is morally responsible for this.

The individuals who surrender are morally responsible for not
resisting heroically, but there is a limit to how much blame can
attach to that.  Facebook, by contrast, has no such mitigation of
blame available.  No one pressured its founders to set it up.

Screaming "you are willfully stupid and ignorant" at people will not
help them say no to Facebook.  It will only make them feel weaker.
However, we can help more people resist by inviting them to be strong.
I try to do that.

It would also help if we stop Facebook from doing some of the things
that create the social pressure.  I am trying to create the beginnings
of a movement to do just that.  I think this calls for government
regulation.

The purpose of democracy is to put a check on the power of the rich,
and that includes stopping businesses from mistreating people.
Businesses are not entitled to a right to operate however they wish.

I think that must be so.

I don't know of any scientific study of how many are in each part of
the spectrum, but we can deduce something from the press.  Many
writers say they don't read the terms and conditions, and assume that
their readers don't.  This doesn't prove that nearly everyone is that
way, but does give evidence that lots of people are that way.  The writers
must know their audience to some extent.

I am sure there are some people who understand how Facebook snoops on
them, are content with that, and sincerely agree to the terms of use.
Arguably Facebook is not doing any wrong _to them_.

But that doesn't excuse what Facebook is systematically doing to the
rest of its useds.

Maybe I understand your meaning, but I the real question is how
this relates to ethical conclusions about facebook.

I suppose there are people who choose in that way to be used by
Facebook.  But there are others who are pushed into it, and some who
fall into it because they are unaware of the issues.

When a business pressures or lures people into mistreatment, I don't
think that can be excused by the existence of some satisfied customers.

I think it is not meaningful to compare a product such as plumbing or
a commodity such as water with a service.  They are too different to
be comparable.

However, I think you're right about the monopoly aspect.  Facebook
acts like a near-monopoly and yet is allowed to impose any rules it
likes.

The water supply is a monopoly for physical reasons: it would be too
expensive for a would-be competitor to make an alternate set of pipes
to supply water through.  Facebook is a near-monopoly for a totally
different reason: the network effect.  It would not be terribly hard
to develop a service that would do more or less what Facebook does.
It's not as easy as falling off a log, but it could be done.  However,
that alternative would almost certainly fail, because people's family
and friends and possible employers would not pressure them to use it.
Rejecting it would not require any heroism; its use would be truly
voluntary.

There is more at stake in k-cups than the taste of the coffee.  They
have DRM (Digital Restrictions Management): they are an intentional
attack on the freedom of coffee drinkers.  To be wise, we should reject
products designed to deny our freedom.

Many people think that Keurig has changed its ways.  Around six months
ago the company made small concession to criticisms: it would resume
selling cups that the user could refill.  However, the DRM remains.

https://www.defectivebydesign.org/may-3rd-is-the-next-day-against-drm

Aside from attacking users' freedom, the k-cups are very
environmentally wasteful compared with making coffee some other way.

    Greetings - Sorry for the error; on closer inspection, the Class Ring 
    for 2007 reads "Georgia Institute of Technology", not MIT. There are the 
    initials, "JJB" inside. - Annie

Instead of publishing such details, you should ask the person who claims
the lost object to tell them to you as proof of being the rightful owner.





The charlie card system was cracked by students here, and others can
crack it to.  Let's not fail to apply the relevant conclusions in our
own lives:

* Always keep your charlie card in aluminum foil except when you
use it to pay.

* Swap charlie cards every few weeks, to foil surveillance by
the "authorities", that can do it without cracking.

* Never put money into the card except by paying cash.

A few months ago, people dropped off quite a few charlie cards
at my office, 32-381.  I put them on the shelf outside my door,
people have taken them.  Now it would be nice to have more I can
redistribute in this way.

If you can slide your old charlie cards under my door when they become
empty, I will be able to put out a new supply for others to reuse.

It's every citizen's duty to blind Big Brother.




For those of us who don't want to use Flash, can you recommend

Thanks -- it's always good to make video materlals available in

    A set of keys has been found in the G4 kitchen area -- one of the keys 
    is laminated with a Red Sox logo on it.

Perhaps it would be wiser NOT to mention little but visible
identifying details, so that you can use them to identify the real
owner.




It is bad to use Flash in web sites.
Doing so pressures people to install a Flash player,
and the only Flash player that handles all the latest
features is a non-free one.  (We are looking for more
volunteers for developing Gnash.)

Is there a reason why the csail web page _needs_ to use Flash?
(I can't see how the answer could be yes, but there could
be a reason I do not know about.)

If not, they should remove it.




Automatic face recognition is part of the planned Orwellian
surveillance system that the US government would like to establish.
The idea is that Big Brother will not only watch you, but will always
know where you are as you walk down the street.

I urge people to refuse any kind of participation in this activity in
this.  Even a little opposition is better than nothing.

We should ask Mr Rivera whether the client software is free/libre.

Meanwhile, the claim that the service can't be cracked (he says
"hacked"), if true, only does part of the job.  There is also the
issue of whether the NSA, or its counterpart in some other country,
will be able to get your files easily.  Many European countries
have essentially no protection against this.

To reduce the information Big Brother can collect about T riders,
it is good to swap charlie cards from time to time.

I have a few slightly used empty charlie cards on hand.  Tomorrow from
10am to 4pm I will be in my office, 32-381, so come by if you want one.

I'd also appreciate it if you drop off an empty charlie card, either
today or tomorrow or afterward.  Slide it under my door if I'm not in.

If your charlie card isn't empty now, you can take a new one
for future use, and give me the old one later when it becomes empty.

    This is also correct, and therein lies the contradiction: if a SaaSS
    has no free program that offers comparable functionality, should it be
    rejected

Yes.  The wrong done by using SaaSS results from the structure of the
activity, so it is independent of whether there currently exists a
free program that does the same job.

The same is true for running a proprietary program.  The wrong it
does to the user is independent of whether a free replacement exists.
That's why it is important to write free replacements for these
nonfree programs (and for SaaSS).

If the absence of a free replacement made them ok, there would
be no reason to replace them.

	     (despite the fact that such a SaaSS would represent the hard
    work of an expert in the field,

That doesn't alter the issue.  A proprietary program also
represents the hard work of an expert in the field, but that
doesn't excuse the proprietary program either.

				    just like any other service in any
    other field)?

Are you talking about services where you pay an expert to do a job for
you?  With SaaSS (or other computerized service), it's not the expert
that does the job for you, it is software.  Whe the job it's doing is
your own computing, i.e. when it is SaaSS, you deserve to have control
over that.

I think the problem of drivers and firmware that affects Replicant
(see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html)
affects all the mostly-free systems for mobile devices.

In a mobile phone, there is also the problem of the back door in the
"modem" or "baseband" processor that can be used to convert the phone
into a listening device.  We think it overwrite and replace whatever
system you have installed.

The phone's location is also tracked using triangulation even if it
has no GPS.

    The question to the candidate is if they would "repeal Citizens
    United". Given that I know of no mechanism to repeal a US Supreme
    Court decision (no matter how much it endangers democracy), I worry
    that this won't be taken very seriously.

Constitutional amendments to undo the Corporations United (*) decision
have already been proposed in Congress.  While pedantically it's
not correct to call these "repealing" the decision, I don't think
we need to be so pedantic.

* Officially that organization called itself "Citizens United..."
but I'd rather call it what it is.

    In <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik1AK56FtVc>, Larry Lessig has
    some interesting talks on how it's political suicide to actually try
    to effect that from Congress and that it should start from the states
    themselves.

I think 16 states have passed resolutions in favor of such an
amendment, but we need to work on Congress as well.

I don't know what Lessig said, but in the context of an election, to
call support for a very popular cause "political suicide" is
presumptuous.  Campaigns like this are what it takes to make that
position a political requirement for candidates.

I'm sad to say that anything done on iOS (the operating system of the
iThings) will be required by Apple to be nonfree software (unless you
tell people, "Please jailbreak your machine to install this").  In
addition, if people like your program, your effort will have gone to
promote Apple's censorship platform.

Please don't develop anything for iOS.  If your work is worth doing,
please make sure it does not support censorship.

Dear Cambridge Supporter of Civil Liberties,

We have worked together for years to ensure that Cambridge remains a bastion of freedom and liberty, even as a creeping surveillance state has taken hold in other parts of the Commonwealth and nationwide.

Now we need your help again, here, to keep Cambridge safe and free:

Cambridge Surveillance Policy Meeting
Thursday, September 26, 2013, at 6pm
Cambridge City Hall
795 Massachusetts Avenue

On September 26 at 6pm, the City of Cambridge is hosting a community meeting to discuss a draft surveillance-camera policy proposed by the Cambridge Police Department. However well intentioned, the policy misrepresents the impact of cameras on public safety, lacks sufficient public input, fails to adequately protect data, and could jeopardize our rights to speech, activity and association. In addition, other police departments will have access to some of these cameras.

Read more about our privacy concerns about the draft policy:

http://click.actions.aclu.org/?qs=2a735ef0345599623ff501a1c3996708cc08257c98b2c5538405ef676dbdd19a 

What can you do to help?

1) Come to the meeting on Thursday, Sept. 26 at 6pm. We want to have a strong presence.
2) Prepare your own testimony to improve the draft camera policy, or to say you don't want any government surveillance on public streets in your neighborhoods.
3) Submit comments (whether or not you can attend the meeting) to:
	- Cambridge City Manager Richard Rossi: rrossi at cambridgema.gov
	- The Cambridge City Council: council at cambridgema.gov

Pushing back against advancing surveillance is vital to maintaining a healthy, democratic society. Please help us keep Cambridge safe and free.

    - The name Richard is incidental (I chose it after Feynman if you must
    know), I apologize if you felt the open source cause or one of its most
    vocal supporters were belittled.

I hope that doesn't refer to me!  I'm no supporter of "open source",
I'm the leader of the free software movement.  People who disagree
with the free software movement coined the term "open source" with
the idea of causing our ideals to be forgotten.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.  See also http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler for
Evgeny Morozov's article on the topic.

I didn't suppose the machine was named after me -- there are lots of
Richards, after all.

    Bitlock is the first bike lock that replaces your key with your phone. It
    senses your proximity and identifies you as you come within 3 feet of your
    bike. Using the app on your phone, you can share the location and access of
    your bike with others and even set up a bike share system for your local
    community.

I fear that one effect of this system will be increased surveillance
of everyone that uses it.  Of course, anyone carrying a portable
phone is already being tracked, but this seems to collect additional
information about the person (specifically, about his bike) and
deliver it to servers where the NSA can get it.

In addition, there is the ethical question of whether Bitlock is
free/libre software or not.

If you are a student or employee and have signing rights on your code
over to MIT, then when you write a program, MIT might interfere with
releasing it as free software or with copylefting it.  If you're in
such a situation, I recommend you read
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/university.html for advice.
It is vital to raise the issue as early as possible, long before

I have three questions to pose about this proposed service:

1. Would it use DRM, requiring nonfree software to play?

2. Would it impose an EULA covering the music itself?

3. Would it require users to identify themselves, with the effect of
   collecting personal information for the US government?

I don't know the answers, but based on other "services" that exist
(see stallman.org/internet-music.html), I expect that either two or
three of the answers are "yes".  Even one "yes" answer would make it
unethical.

Another bad thing is that the job offer asks (or demands?) that people
to use LinkedIn, which collects lots of personal information it
doesn't have a right to (and treacherously swipes people's email
contact lists).

The ethical ways to get copies of music are (1) buying CDs and (2)
redistribution among listeners.  To avoid being antisocial, please
reject any scheme for music distribution that would put obstacles
in the way of your sharing with your friends.

This job offer talks about medical monitoring, and mentions the use of
EC2 servers.  I hope that doesn't mean it will send users' personal
medical data to a server, because that violates people's privacy.

The ethical way implement something like this is to keep the data only
on the users' own computer and/or devices.  To assure users that
nothing is snooping on them in their own computers, the software in
the user's computer needs to be free.

This hypothetical compilation service is an example of what we call
"Service as a Software Substitute", or SaaSS.  SaaSS denies the you
control over your computing; for your freedom's sake, you ought to
refuse to use it.  Thus, we recommend rejecting this on principle.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html

using a nonfree program that spies on you and has a universal back
door.

I think it is folly to give some company total and absolute control

gratis.  I would not use it if they paid me to, either -- unless they
paid me millions of dollars, enough that I could use it to hire people
to develop a free software replacement compiler for that language.

I suspect an exaggeration here.  Do you have data to show what
fraction of free range parents have legal trouble?  I doubt such data
exist.  How many free range parents are there?  I don't think anyone
can count them.

Usually we find out about them when we read about how the state
harasses them.  That skews the data and will tend to give the
impression that they are all being harassed.

Whatever the fraction may be, we need to exercise our rights so that
we don't lose them.

I support the free range kids movement.  I used to walk 5 blocks to
school on my own when I was 6 years old, and nobody thought that was
strange.  Of course, that was in Manhatten -- perhaps people in the
suburbs didn't dare do such things.

Someone claimed that free software can't do a good job, so I said it
can and we often do.  That addressed the question on the table.

In the past, apparently, I said that we can't _force_ our volunteers
to do a good job.  I don't remember saying this, but I'll take your
word that I did so.  Anyway, it is true.

Both of these statements are true.  They don't conflict.  But it's not
nice to do what you did, which is to cite what I said about a
different question and present the two statements as a contradiction.

It's also true that you can't sue the volunteers for making a mistake.
True, but not pertinent to the question on the table.  So I won't
go down that tangent.

We can't force a person to work on a program and do a good job,
but we can look for a better maintainer.

Would you like to volunteer to maintain a currently unmaintained GNU
package?  Or help raise funds to hire a maintainer for one?  That
would be a constructive approach.

Regarding medical software:

The MIT Medical department asks patients to communicate though a
web site called "Follow My Health", which I call "Tracking Your Health".

I don't know of any bugs in that site, because I have never tried it.
But I do now of grave _intentional_ flaws, which are found in the
terms of service.  For instance, the company is allowed to release
personal data if it has been "anonymized" in a very simple and
ineffective way.

With features like this, who needs bugs?

Many proprietary programs are intentional malware.
See http://gnu.org/proprietary/ for dozens of examples.

With features like this, who needs bugs?

Karen Sandler of the Software Freedom Conservancy, along with Vice
President Cheney, chose to have implanted defibrillator with no radio,
so that the nonfree software in it could not be remotely changed.

With features like this, who needs bugs?

When a free program has a flaw, the users are free to fix it.
When a nonfree program is malware, or when a service is a disservice,
the users have no way to fix it.  The only solution is, don't use it!

Can you demonstrate that claim?  The contract I saw did not bar the
company from selling this "anonymized" data to data brokers.

The contract might be different today.  Another thing I saw in it was
that the company can change it at any time without warning the users.
That's effectively an "I agree to be a total sucker" clause.

Either the terms of service or the privacy policy stated that

That's *very simple*.

As for *ineffective*, here's what I wrote:

Th terms stated no limit on how large a record they can distribute
about a patient.  Research has shown that, given a lot of information
about a person, it often becomes easy to reidentify per.  Thus, the
company is _allowed_ to release data in a way that has been anonymized
ineffectively.  QED.

I did not say that this company's anonymization is _always,
invariably_ ineffective.  I said that the company's terms of service
_allow_ it to do "anonymization" which is ineffective.

I agree.  Software that can't be changed might as well be a circuit:
see http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-hardware-designs.html.  Thus, I
don't see anything wrong with the YubiKey itself.

The problem I am concerned with is in DUO, which (according to
previous reports here) requires running nonfree software.

  > However to be honest, the MIT systems you are entering

MIT's running that software; if it is nonfree, MIT's freedom is what's
trampled: that code doesn't directly affect students' freedom.

I urge MIT to drop the nonfree software in order to recover control
over its computing, but students have no reason to feel directly affected
by the question.

						 (including portions running in
  > Javascript in your browser).

By asking students to run this nonfree software, MIT is directly doing
them wrong.  If it is hard for students to refuse, that's a bigger
wrong.

If it is a matter of occasionally getting information from MIT or
giving information to MIT, one solution is to do so by logging in on
an MIT kiosk (an MIT computer) offered for students (and/or others) to
communicate with MIT.  They could enter and see data directly, or via
a USB memory.  Students, when using that computer, would not be
running the nonfree Javascript code; MIT would be running it.  The
students would be communicating with MIT, not themselves doing any
computing.

This would be comparable to using a bank's ATM to commnicate with the
bank (including withdrawing money).  The computer in the ATM is doing
the bank's computing, not the customer's computing, so it's the bank
that ought to have control over it.  The customer is simply talking
to the bank.

Does MIT make available computers that students can do this on?

but that was too dismissive of the issue.  Nonfree software often
contains malicious functionalities, including snooping and back doors.
(See http://gnu.org/proprietary/.)  When MIT uses nonfree software in
connection with teaching or for dealing with students, it puts
students' privacy at risk.

Nonetheless, overall it remains true that when MIT, not the students,
are running a nonfree program, the direct loss of freedom affects MIT,
not the students.

Please think twice before buying from Amazon -- or

The term "cloud" is used for so many different practices that it has
come to mean nothing more than "we use the network somehow".
How about using a more specific term instead?

It's clear that Hubway knows where a client picks up a bicycle.  It
probably also nows where the client leaves it.  Does it also follow
where the bicycle goes, with GPS perhaps?

Is there someone at CSAIL who would like to determine this?

In the meantime, I recommend that people get and use their
own bicycles, rejecting systems that do surveillance.

Speaking of surveillance, many people at MIT have monthly t-passes.
You can swap those with other people every few days to thwart
surveillance.

If you use charlie cards, you can swap those too.  You can find some
empty used charlie cards on a ledge next to the door of my office,
32-381.  It would be nice if you drop off empty charlie cards, too.
Remeber, use only cash to refill a charlie card, so that Big Brother
doesn't get your name.

It's every citizen's duty to stick a finger in Big Brother's eye.

This is not as bad as it could be.  But it is still bad.

Hubway will surely insist on some way to charge for lost or broken
bikes.  But I can envision a system by which they would not record
where a bike was checked out, or where it was checked in, unless it is
overdue.  They could also have anonymous accounts with people who
place a security deposit, and they could accept that in cash.
You would need to close an account from time to time and open another.
We would need to make sure they can't tie one to the next.

Memorial Drive is a major artery, the fastest way by car to a lot of
places.  I don't have a car, but when I ride in other people's cars,
that is often the way to get somewhere.  I worry that reducing it to
two lanes would cause a lot of slowdown, so I don't support this
change.

This makes no sense to me.  The rotary slows everyone that goes into
it, but the overpass sure speeds traffic along Memorial Drive.  If it would
be an improvement to replace the rotary, why not do it and keep the overpass?

Dr Richard Stallman

Internet Hall-of-Famer (https://internethalloffame.org)





My residence is not in the Stata Center, and I would surely have
visited the transportation fair if I were in Cambridge today.

Some of you who arrived this academic year may not know about the
Charlie Card trading scheme that I set up.  By swapping Charlie Cards
every few weeks or every month, we can reduce the information that Big
Brother gets from them.

On a ledge to the right of my office door (room 381) you can find a
few Charlie Cards which have been previously used by others.  Take
one; later, when your current card becomes empty, switch to the new
one.  Then leave the old one either on the ledge or under my door.
(If you leave a card on the ledge, I would appreciate your slipping an
anonymous paper note under my door to tell me you did so.)

Remember, never feed your Charlie Card except with cash.  The other
methods are not anonymous and Big Brother gets to link the card with
your name.  Then he knows every time and place you use it.




Tracking where people use cards such as Charlie cards
is a real system that is used now.  You've pointed out
many potential systems that might theoretically be used
in the future.

Someday they may be a real concern, but worrying about them
now would just be a distraction from the real issue.




Those who are interested in campaigning against this,
how about writing to me off the list?




You are entitled to your opinion about card-swapping, but your
arguments seem to be based on remote extrapolations or on a defeatist
assumption (whatever we do, they will crush us).

I think that this is so easy we would be fools NOT to try it,
regardless of whatever else we might want to do.




Some people get MTA passes thru MIT.  Does MIT keep track of who gets
what pass?  If so, maybe that is an area where we should push for
change, along with campaigning against the plan to combine them
with MIT IDs.





    MIT keeps a list of MBTA pass numbers associated with MIT ids that buy them through the employee-discounted program (possible of the
    students as well).

This is very bad, since it essentially pays people to surrender their
privacy.  We should call on MIT to offer anonymous passes.

It should not be hard to make the passes anonymous and still give
people a way to cancel them and get a new one.  They could give you
the pass plus a piece of paper which says its number.  You save that
paper, and maybe copy the number into your computer for good measure.
If you lose the pass, you give them that number, and they can cancel the
pass and give you a new one with a new number.

I think they could even let you renew your pass each month without
their having to know its number, using something like David Chaum's
digital cash technique.  You pay, and they give you a signature of a
blinded number.  Then you anonyously submit that number to the MTA
and get them to renew your pass.





    Advocating that people participate in a card-swapping pool by saying 
    that it is in some vague way good for privacy -- in absence of an 
    informed, reasoned, viable strategy -- seems premature and misleading.  
    That's what I was objecting to.

It is an informed, reasoned, viable strategy to resist a surveillance
system that we know is in use.  You've mentioned others that may
someday be used.  You gave no evidence they are in use here and now,
and I think some are not technically feasible today.  They may ne used
someday, and I would welcome proposals for how to counter them.

However, it is clear that getting people to join in a campaign against
one kind of surveillance will strengthen the will to resist orwellian
surveillance no matter how it is done.






Rather than continuing to discuss this on the list,
how about if those interested in participating in a campaign
write to me off the list?

I think so, but I don't see how that relates.

For any program, to modify it you have to know (more or less) the
programming language it is written in.  That's the same for all cases.

"Access to it via [per] own web server" is exactly the problem.
This problem is the same, for the wizard's version on per web server,
as for the original version on some company's web server.

If you run a program straight off someone's web site -- no matter who
that is -- the site operator could impose changes on you at any
moment.

With ordinary software that you install and then run from your own
machine, you don't need to be much of a wizard to install someone's
version from source if the GNU build conventions are followed.
You can also install binary package versions.

Once you install a version, it will not change unless you decide to
install another version.  We the community have control, this way, over
what versions we are using.

Thanks.

Publishing this partial information could do some harm, if some people
are reidentified; but they themselves know who each rider is, so their
snooping is much worse than it appears from this data set.

The system could be designed such that they don't record who took a
bike if it was returned on time.  It would be easy, for the short

Do they enable privacy as well?  Snooping/tracking is the grave danger
in nearly all digital activities, and when applied to driverless cars,
it threatens to track where people go.  The only reliable way to
prevent it is to design the systems so that they don't record events
in a way that threatens privacy.

If you were asking people to work for you personally, that personal

I consider it acceptable to talk with MIT through MIT's kiosk because
the whole operation is MIT's computing.  I am only talking with MIT.

I consider it acceptable to talk with the post office using the post
office's kiosk, because the whole operation is the post office's
kiosk.

But that analysis does not fit the scenario of talking with the post
office web site using MIT's kiosk.  In that scenario, MIT would be
acting for me, not for the post office.

  > I'm also not sure what you mean about it functioning internally with

  > why is that not your concern?

How MIT does its computing is not my concern.  If MIT decides to do
its computing using Google Docs, I don't have a reason (or a right) to
demand changes in that.  I might say I think MIT is being unwise, but
that is only advice.  It is no skin off my back, because I'm not the
one using Google Docs.

In he scenario of using the MIT kiosk to talk with MIT, it's all
MIT's computing, so that applies to all of it.

I think you're working from premises I don't agree with.  One might be
something like, "It doesn't matter which machine any particular code
runs on, only which code runs."

I think it makes a difference whether code runs on my machine, just as
it matters whether you take your clothes off in your house or my
house.  Even if they are the same clothes and you remove them the same
way.

Another one of your principles might be something like, "If a service
does something when serving you, that's equivalent to your doing it
directly."

That is valid for some kinds of issues.  For instance, if it is a
matter of consuming resources, it doesn't matter whether one uses them
directly or indirectly.  Likewise, if it is a matter of snooping on
data stored somewhere, it doesn't matter whether I put my data
somewhere or MIT puts it there.

However, when it is a matter of how a service interacts with its
users, it makes a difference who is interacting with it.  I won't run
the nonfree software to interact with use Google Docs, but if MIT
decides to run it I'm not personally affected.

It seems to me that someone could make a "USB memory filter" that you
put between a USB memory and your computer, which would allow the
memory to act like a memory, but would block it from acting like
anything else.

The filter would check what data the memory sends to the computer,
verify it is acting exactly like a memory, and block its communication
if it tries to do anything that a real memory would not do.

The issue does not depend on trusting or not trusting the operating
system.  A malicious USB memory that pretends to be a keyboard will
fool any operating system (whether free/libre or not) if it trusts
what the USB device says to it.

The operating system could fix this by asking the user to approve, for
each USB device, what the USB device says it does.  If the operating
system is free/libre, users could change it to fix this.  If the system
is nonfree, only its owner could make this change.

My USB memory filter idea is meant to address the threat, previously
mentioned, in which the USB memory pretends to be a keyboard and takes
over your computer.

It is possible to convert an ordinary USB memory into such a threat
just by changing the software in it.

This is a different issue.  The USB memory filter is not meant to
protect against this.

However, at least the transmitter in the memory won't enable it to
take over your computer.

You're continuing to attack the same all-or-nothing straw man.  If you
can't bring yourself to reject all nonfree software, reject some
nonfree software.  Each time you say no to _some_ nonfree software,
you will recover some of your freedom.  Each time people see you say
no to _some_ nonfree software, you will make it easier for others to
say no.

It is entirely practical.  Whatever you can reject, rejecting it is
practical.

Perhaps you mean it is not concrete.  That's true -- because in order
to fit everyone, it can't be fixed in shape.

A discussion of long-term strategy for the free software movement

I wrote about Google Docs since it was pertinent to how this list is
used.  I don't think I would win much support by bringing up issues
that are not a propos of anything we see CSAIL saying or doing.

       I can't 
    do anything about surveymonkey's javascript, but the fact that your 
    email has reached me indicates that you are willing for your data to be 
    handled be nonfree code in some cases,

I don't know what software runs in your computer or in surveymonkey's
server, and I have not asked.  If you run nonfree software, it harms
your freedom.  If surveymonkey runs nonfree software, it harms
surveymonkey's freedom.  Either way, it does not affect my freedom.

Thus, I hope you and/or surveymonkey will escape from any nonfree
software you use, but in the mean time it is no obstacle to my
answering your survey.

But the issue I raised is a different kind.

					   so perhaps that will be the case 
    for the survey as well.

Perhaps you don't recognize the issue with Javascript code.
Surveymonkey wants to run nonfree Javascript software _in the computer
of the person answering the survey_.

Thus, the issue is not that you're running nonfree software yourself
(if you are).  The issue is that you've set up the survey such that
the way to answer it is by running nonfree software.

I won't run nonfree software, so I can't answer.  However, some other
people might be led into running nonfree software in order to answer.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html for an explanation
of this issue.

Would you please set up your future surveys directly so that they
work without Javascript?

    rms's point is that he doesn't want non-free software running on HIS 
    machine.

The reason I object to nonfree Javascript code is the same reason I
object to nonfree C or Python or Lisp code: it is not under the users'
control.  I won't run nonfree software written in Javascript any more
than I would run nonfree software written in C.

Javascript is special because its usage scenario is special.  Web
sites send Javascript; they don't send C.  The nonfree code that tries
to install itself in our computers is typically written in Javascript.
See http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html.

I don't know whether MIT's routers or mail server run nonfree
software, but if it's nonfree software, that doesn't injure me.  It
injures MIT, but it's no skin off my back.  I do care about an injury
to MIT, but not in the irrational way some wish I did.

Likewise, I don't know what code runs in the surveymonkey.com server.
Maybe it is free software, maybe it isn't.  If they wrote it
themselves and run it privately, it is unreleased free software;
nothing wrong with that.  Otherwise, it might trample Surveymonkey's
freedom, and I think that is regrettable, but I won't have a cow about
it.

However, when surveymonkey.com tries to make me run a nonfree program
by sending it to me in a web page, that's an attack on my freedom.  I
won't let it run, so I can't answer Karger's survey.

If someone wants to run nonfree software to do a survey, I would
advise him to to stop, but I won't beg and plead for him to stop.

But please, please, don't ask the people you are surveying to run
nonfree software!

Nonfree software is software for suckers -- see

    I think you both are (perhaps intentionally) misreading Richard's
    message.  Richard considers it your loss if you or anyone else is
    using "freedom-destroying" software, but that's not his concern here.
    What he is saying is that he's not going to respond to your survey
    because doing so requires *him* to run non-free software.

Aw shucks, they were having so much fun criticizing the absurd straw
man, and you ruined it by explaining what I really meant ;-).

Here's the crucial distinction.  If you run a nonfree program
yourself, you're surrendering your freedom.  But if you ask someone
else to run a nonfree program, you're leading him to surrender his
freedom.

The first one is your affair.  I hope you won't do it, but if you do
it, that's no reason for me to refuse to talk to your computer.
Likewise, I wouldn't refuse to be your friend because you smoke
tobacco, though I would feel some concern.

However, inviting lots of people to run a nonfree program is like
inviting hundreds of people visit a room that you've filled with
invisible odorless tar and nicotine.  It is harmful to many, not just
to you.

Thus I ask people, when running surveys, to make sure a person can
answer the survey without running nonfree Javascript code.  It is not
hard at all; surveymonkey's mistreatment of the users is gratuitous.

    I will give up my freedom and submit your responses for you through
    surveymonkey if you are willing to send them to me. If you need access to
    the questions, I can just email them to you if you wish. Would this ease
    your concerns about "attacks on your freedom"?

I would not ask you to sacrifice your freedom in my stead.
However, if Karger wants to email me the questions, I would be glad
to email him the responses.  They he could include them in the results
without going through surveymonkey.

Freedom is having control of your own life.  If you use a nonfree
program, that gives the developer power over you, and that is the
injustice.

I don't need to know whether you currently wish to change the program
before I can conclude that the developer should not have power over
you.

    Richard, I understand the points you raise but I don't think you 
    understood mine.

I think I understand it.  You do not attach significance to the
distinction between the programs I run in my computer and the programs
that others might run in their computers.  You think I should consider
them the same -- but I don't.

I'm entitled to control over what my computer(*) does.  That control
is possible only with free software.  Nonfree software in my computer
would give its developer control over what I do in it, and I won't
allow that.

I'm not entitled to control over MIT's routers by any standard.  It's
MIT that's entitled to control over them, I believe.  Such control is
possible only with free software, so I advise MIT to put free software
in them.

This is why I reach different conclusions in these different
circumstances.

    it is helping us to gather information that will help us 
    to create open source (yes I understand the difference between open 
    source and free) software to benefit society.

I consider a nonfree program an injustice.  Nearly all open source
programs are free/libre, but there are exceptions, so the information
you've given is not enough for me to conclude with certainty whether I
should want to help you develop it.

Is your program free software?

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.  See also http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler for
Evgeny Morozov's article on the same point.

      If I set up selenium to run surveymonkey's js on a different 
    machine and then sent the output html to your machine, would that 
    absolve you of the responsibility for "running" surveymonkey's js and 
    allow you to answer the survey?

Yes, it would -- because you would be running that nonfree software,
not me.  For the same reason, I don't investigate whether your web
server runs a free HTTP server and a free operating system before I
fetch a page from it.

However, in practice it would be much easier for you to set up a web
page which lets me answer the questions through an HTML form.  Why not
do that?

    And why this distinction between js and html?  At least in combination 
    with CSS, html is turing complete,

When I investigated this issue, I found that such programming was
possible in theory but not feasible in practice.

    Surveymonkey's website says it requires Javascript, but that's not true.
    I was able to take the survey using an elinks browser compiled without support
    for Javascript.

I tried the page in Firefox with Javascript disabled, and the page did
not work.  So how does elinks make it work?  What's the crucial
difference between that and the graphical browser I used?
Is there a <noscript> that arranged not to show me the questions?

I have nothing against using JS to implement a nicer user interface
if that's all it does.  But they ought to make it free.

And why make the page refuse to function when the browser has JS
disabled?  If it had WORKED, I would simply have answered.

    Yes. There's a noscript tag that has a stylesheet which hides the survey:

How stupid and nasty of them.

    If you delete that node in your graphical browser's developer console each
    time you load one of the survey pages, you can take the survey graphically.

I did not know there was a "developer console".  I should probably
learn about this, but I wouldn't go to that much effort to answer the
survey.  The survey should be set up in a way that doesn't make this
effort necessary.

    How do you ethically reconcile sorting out the malicious and
    illegal activities such as child trafficking on these networks
    from the more benevolent uses of such technology?

Proceeding from the principle that people have a right to communicate
privately, monitored only persuant to specific court orders, clearly
MIT should not be reluctant to have a Tor node because of bad things
people might say through it, any more than it should be reluctant to
have a pay phone because of bad things people might say through it.

Ordinary Android is not quite as nasty as an iBad, because it is not a
jail: you can install free/libre apps from f-droid.

Nonetheless, it is bad in a number of ways: for details, see
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html.  If you
want freedom, you should replace it with Replicant.  That gets a lot
closer (though in a phone there is still the universal back door

    This all seems quite complicated, I think the easiest solution is to 
    direct people to the 3rd Floor HQ Office, they can give directions or 
    call the person the visitor is here to see.

It seems like a fine solution if the people in HQ don't mind the workload.
To implement it well calls for large and visible arrows in a number of places
on the 1st floor and 3rd floor (both inside and outside areas).

Uber is yet another surveillance system.  It requires a "smartphone"
(personal tracking and surveillance device) to call a car.  It
requires you to identify yourself, and records where you go.  (I
suspect it also requires running nonfree software, but I don't know.)

If Uber is very successful, you will no longer be able to find a cab
on the street and pay the fare in cash.  Please join me in defending
privacy by refusing to use Uber.

    This literally has nothing to do with Uber, clearly you did not read past
    the first sentence.

You have jumped to a conclusion.  In fact, I read the rest of the
message, but that topic has no particular interest for me.

The message mentioned the Uber surveillance system in the most harmful
possible way: briefly, in passing, assuming without question that it's good.
That reinforces that assumption, if it isn't questioned.

Many new surveillance systems are cemented into society by users whose
minds are on other things.  Because their minds are on other things,
they never take up the question of whether these systems are
dangerous.  It is necessary to raise the question when people mention
them in passing.

I realize now that I should have changed the subject in my first
message.  I read mail with Rmail in Emacs, which shows me a whole
screenful of each message, so I tend to lose sight of how others
depend on subject lines.  Please forgive me.

    An article recently posted to Hacker News shows (in enthusiasm over "open 
    data") that, at least in New York City, cabs on the street paid in cash 
    also surveil you in the same way, tracking dropoff and pickup locations to 
    high precision, _and_ that this data is subject to freedom-of-information 
    requests from the general public:

    http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/

Looking at the article, it seems that the data they collect does not
identify the passenger.  This is hardly surveillance in "the same way"
as Uber.  I don't consider this system a particular problem.

    Please join me in 
    opposing governmental surveillance by refusing to use taxis.

I can't be sure, but I think you did not mean this seriously.
However, in New York City we really should reject taxis because of
another surveillance system not mentioned in that article.

A taxi driver told me he was required to buy and install a
surveillance camera that would photograph each passenger and _send the
photo immediately to the New York Thug Department_.  That's
what makes it a surveillance camera.

By contrast, car services put security cameras in the car.  I don't
mind security cameras, whose recordings are viewed only when there is
a crime.  I have never attacked a driver and I am too old to start
now, and it is unlikely that the driver will be attacked by someone
else in close temporal proximity to my ride.

Thus, in New York City I will not take a taxi but I will use a
conventional car service.

However, I don't think Boston and Cambridge have put surveillance
cameras in the taxis, so there is no reason (that I know of) to reject
taxis in Boston and Cambridge.

In Canberra, Australia, taxis don't just take photos; they record
passengers' conversations, too.  Or at least, that's what the sign on
the taxi door claimed.

I wrote down on a paper

   Don't speak!  Cab is bugged!
   Please take me to ...address...

and handed it to the driver, who laughed and took me there.
I said not one word during the drive.

My note was a joke but the point was true.  There is a serious effort
to eliminate all ways and places for whistleblowers to communicate
privately with journalists, and it threatens democracy.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html for
explanation, as well as the distinction between a surveillance camera
and a security camera.

    Are you suggesting that the best benefit for marginalized minorities is to
    keep prices and quality arbitrarily high?

Yes, it does -- for services which are used mainly by the wealthy.
(Which is most services.)

In general, making services cheaper by paying workers less increases
poverty.  The workers will become poor, while the savings go to the
better-off.  Poor people don't buy a lot of services.

Members of marginalized minorities are usually poor, or almost poor.
They can't afford taxis, or Uber.  The poor often don't have credit
cards or bank accounts, so they could not use Uber even if they needed
to.  If Uber is cheaper, that is not going to help them save any money.

The main way taxis affect those people is that some of them get out of
poverty by driving cabs.  If Uber replaces taxis, that would stop.
Some of them could drive for Uber instead, but you need a car for that,
and these people mostly can't afford to own a car.

If the taxi medallion owners hire drivers and pay them badly, that
would reduce this effect somewhat, but won't eliminate it entirely.

Since lifting people out of poverty is one of the principal missions
of the state, banning Uber would be entirely legitimate.

    I was part of the interactive team working on the story, and so today EVERY
    time I have a conversation with an Uber (or cab) driver I ask what their
    experience is.  I have not once been told by an Uber driver that they don't
    love what they do compared to what they did.

How many Uber drivers make a living mainly from that?

How many of them were formerly taxi drivers and prefer being
Uber drivers?

I think we should discard the term "sharing economy", because we
should reserve the term "sharing" for when nobody is in it for profit.

      If it could be
    shown that the Free Software movement was harmful to the jobs of poor
    people, would you abandon it?

No, because free software is a necessary prerequisite for a computer
user's personal freedom.  If protecting personal freedom has a small
negative economic effect, we can cancel that out with some other
economic intervention whose effect is opposite.

Fortunately, free software and spreading the wealth do not conflict --
they go together.  Proprietary software tends to concentrate wealth.
This is an additional secondary wrong of proprietary software, beyond
trampling the user's freedom.

    If Uber replaces taxis (instead of simply coexisting with them), then
    perhaps taxis have lost their relevance in our economy.

With that sort of reasoning, if we ban Uber that will prove taxis
still have relevance in the economy.  Implicitly you are simply citing
the panglossian supposition that the invisible hand always creates the
best of all possible worlds.

    There's an argument to be made about the effects of the "sharing economy"
    on poverty, but that's a convenient distraction from the more central
    question of "why is there poverty" (to which the answer is probably not
    "because we didn't protect the taxi industry well enough").

We know the main cause of poverty in the US: dooH niboR policies
that take from the non-rich and give to the rich.

There are many specific policies which contribute to this.  I think we
will find that Uber is one of them.  Clearly it is not the biggest
one.  We're talking about Uber now because Uber was mentioned.

A measure of the effectiveness of dooH niboR: the rate of poverty in
the UK has doubled since 30 years ago, even though the GDP has doubled
and the population has not.

    I'm curious how you're able to claim that people should have 100% control
    over the computer that they own (with exceptions for criminal use)

That's a misleading statement of my views.  I say that users should
have full control over their computing, with NO exceptions.

Some of the things one can do with a computer are illegal.  Some
should be illegal.  It is possible to use a computer for spreading
viruses, for fraud, for conspiracy to murder, even for ordering crimes
against humanity.  I fully endorse the laws which prohibit those
actions, and I wish the US would enforce the last of them against
Dubya.

But that is not an exception to the principle that users deserve
control over their computer.  Rather, it says that use of a computer
is no excuse for a crime.

I think that spreading software that does DRM, surveillance,
censorship or back doors ought to be illegal too.

    , while
    at the same time claiming that they should not have that same control over
    the car that they own (with exceptions for criminal use).

As before, you have distorted my views.

I think a driver should have full control over the car, and a car
owner or long-term lessor should have full control over the software
in the car.  However, there should be laws about how you drive a car,
and business requires regulation.  It is ok to have regulations about
offering a commercial service of giving people rides.

I propose a regulation that such a service must offer the customer a
reasonable and practical way to request a ride, take the ride, and pay
for it without doing anything that systematically identifies per.  If
this regulation were in place, Uber would find a way to satisfy it.

    But your correction only serves to strengthen my point -- if one owns
    something, you suggest they have the freedom to use it as they see fit (and
    face whatever consequences may arise from using it illegally).

That paraphrase changes the meaning of what I said, but not so much as
before.

I think it is wrong for a car, or a program, or any other thing you
might buy or even lease, to come with a license saying that you can't
use it to do X or Y.  However, whether it is illegal to do X or Y is a
separate question entirely.

Thus, I would condemn any car manufacturer that made the purchaser of
the car agree not to use it to sell rides.  However, regulations on
ride-selling business are a different issue.

      What
    regulations exist that prevent any but pre-approved individuals from
    offering their software development services to others?

Many states have such regulations, for projects which might affect
public safety.  I have not yet formulated views on whether these
regulations are good or bad.  Anyway, it is a different question from
regulating taxi service.

    On the other hand, if the artificial scarcity of medallions causes
    taxi drivers to take home far less than they're charging their
    passengers, then it's possible the pay scale is not so different
    from a system like Uber.

Since Uber requires the driver to supply a car, it is not directly
comparable to driving someone else's taxi as an employee.

    I've heard numerous anecdotes that Uber is far better than a taxi,
    not only because it is cheaper, but because the cars tend to show
    up on time.

Uber must offer some advantage for customers to use it, but that's a
different question.

    I think we will find the exact opposite is true. In a city with massive
    public transportation infrastructure, car service is a luxury good.

That's right.  So the question is, does driving your car for Uber pay
more or less than driving a taxi that you own (even supposing you
don't have your own medallion and pay for use of someone else's)?

I expect that Uber pays less, because it isn't looking for full-time
drivers, just people that have a car and want a little extra money.
Those people might not calculate the cost of wear on the car in
deciding whether it's worthwhile use of their time, as a taxi owner
will.  Thus I expect Uber can get drivers while paying less than a
taxi owner/driver would receive, and therefore it will do so.

That is an empirical question, and if someone gets an empirical
answer, it would trump this prediction.  In the absence of an
empirical answer, I assert based on this reasoning that Uber makes the
luxury good cheaper by cutting workers' pay.

    we've
    created a mechanism for the transference of liquid assets (cash) from those
    who have it to those who do not.

The people this money goes to are car owners.  Some of them might be
broke, but the urban poor are not among them, because the urban poor
don't have cars (unless the car substitutes for a home).

    The presumption behind using using government regulation to ensure
    that a service is being provided by good people up to expected
    standards is that the government is a trusted entity to determine
    who good people and what expected standards are.

I trust the Department of Motor Vehicles to test drivers' skill.
So does Uber, since it requires driving licenses.

I think that being a taxi driver require a special class of license
that has a stricter test?  Uber requires only an ordinary license,
right?  So Uber trusts the DMV just as much, but asks it for less.

Meanwhile, taxi regulation includes other rules for the sake of safety
for drivers and passengers.  Uber tries to replace them with total
tracking, but I prefer the taxi's systems since tracking is bad
in itself.

   (Why not offer an unbounded number of Medallions to anyone who
   passes the "trust inspection", for only the fee necessary to pay
   the person doing the inspecting?)

Taxi medallions prevent the problem that too many people enter the
taxi business, so each one spends most of the time waiting for
passengers, and each taxi runs at a loss.  The problem is one form of
"market failure".

Uber solves that problem by using drivers who are doing this on the
side and own cars for other reasons.  On a small scale, there is
nothing wrong with that; but if Uber replaced taxis, the job of taxi
driver would disappear as an opportunity for full-time work you can
support yourself with.

Others have claimed that taxi medallions were intended to filter who
could run a taxi, but I am skeptical.  Was that ever a stated purpose?

    I think you are confusing the protection from involuntary risk (which
    recently failed to prevent the financial crisis) with prohibition from
    taking on voluntary risk (which in one instance failed so spectacularly
    that we now call it "prohibition").

My message was terse, so I shouldn't blame you if interpreted it in
a way that seems strange to me.

The distinction between "voluntary" and "involuntary" is not so
simple.  Poor people frequently encounter situations where all the
choices are bad.  Then they make a "voluntary" choice, which is bad.
For instance, many Americans "voluntarily" skip medicine to buy food
for themselves or for their children.  They may "voluntarily" risk
arrest by leaving the baby in the car they live in, so as to go to a
job interview.  These risky choices are "voluntary" in form, but not
in substance.

Society should make sure people don't end up in such situations.

Now for a less extreme and therefore perhaps more interesting example:
portable phones.  Strictly speaking, allowing yourself to be tracked
by a portable phone is voluntarily.  I demonstrate that every day by
declining to do so.  But various people tell me they can't participate
normally in society without one.  The argument that "It is ok for
portable phones to track people because carrying one is voluntary" is
not valid -- even though it is _possible_ to reject them.

Some risks really are voluntary.  In general, I don't advocate banning
voluntary risks (for instance, mountain climbing, or taking a possibly
dangerous drug) to protect the risk-taker.  But when the risk is only
as "voluntary" as carrying a portable phone, society should either make
the risk safer or eliminate the pressure to take the risk.

In general, non-rich people who support families are scared of taking
risks to make money, because losing the gamble could mean final
disaster.  (Don't compare this to high-tech startups; usually the
worst direct consequence of their failure is that you have to get a
job.)  If lots of non-rich people start taking such risks, it shows
society is not offering them a safe alternative, and that is a bad
society.

    In other words, let's give the poor money through direct transfers or wage
    subsidies,

I agree completely.

	       instead of trying to outsmart the market into inefficient but
    more equal outcomes.

It's easy to outsmart something that is aiming for the wrong goal.

The market is not, after all, very smart.  There are many known cases
of market failure, and known techniques for artificially correcting
them.  They do the market's job but do it better.

This is not such a case.  Here the point is that the market is
optimizing the wrong variable.

In recent decades, the market has made the US workforce far more
efficient, and the benefits have gone mainly to the richest few
percent.  It makes sense to trade possible increased efficiency for
higher employment.  This will prevent the increase of poverty.

We also need to give money to the poor so that everyone
gets a decent life.  But that's a different issue.

Calling this "command-and-control" is just a way of sneaking in the
assumption that regulation of business is bad.

Business must be regulated.  Otherwise it will cheat and trample
people.  Plenty of examples are available in the political notes
of stallman.org.

      Personally, I
    think non-compete agreements are terrible things, but that's a choice
    I can only make for myself -- not a choice I should prevent others
    from being allowed to make.

Nobody proposed that you personally should make this decision.
What's being proposed is a democratic decision not to allow
noncompetition agreements in Massachusetts.

Why set a general policy about this?  Why not let each business and
each employee negotiate?  Because in such negotiations the business
has the whip hand and the employees have to give in.  In general,
employees come out much better when they deal with businesses
collectively.

    I'm curious whether, in the absence of non-compete clauses, it would
    be a viable business model to hire employees from your competitor (the
    ones who have seen your competitor's trade secrets) instead of
    spending the time to research & develop the technology yourself.

You can be curious about anything you like, but in terms of the issue
at hand, it is a secondary point.  The point that really matters is to
restrain the clout of companies to impose restriction on workers.

To kkw: if you are at MIT, I am sure you can find a job that doesn't
involve running Losedows.

    Other than that, I love virtualizing Windows, Linux, and other OS'es

Linux is not an operating system, just a kernel.  It is not enough to
be useful by itself.  See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html.

You can probably run GNU/Linux on top of a proprietary virtual machine
system.  But it is not a good thing to do, becuase the proprietary
virtual machine denies your freedom just like any other proprietary
software.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ for more explanation.




    In my mind this statement is flat out offensive. I can't speak for 
    anyone else, but with all due respect, it isn't my job to support your 
    organizations goals.

Nobody said you should do that.

The Free Software Foundation is a means to an end, and that end is
freedom for computer users (e.g., all of us).  The reason it's bad to
use Windows is not for the sake of the FSF, it's because Windows takes
away your freedom.

I'm concerned about this because I think you deserve freedom, but I
can't force you to accept it.  I hope however that raising the issue
will encourage people to think about whether software respects their
freedom.

			 Certain software for Windows (e.g. MS Office, Adobe 
    Illustrator) just work a lot better for my needs than any free software 
    alternative and use of such software results in a net benefit to me. 

It sounds like you define your "needs" and "benefit" in such a way
that freedom isn't a major part of them.  Many people see things that
way, and that's why it is useful to point out that there is another
way.

If part of what you need is freedom, then you need not to use Windows,
and you need not to use those other programs either.  Not because I
said so, but for your own sake.

    It is unfortunate for you that common usage has deprived you of credit 
    in this situation... if you felt this was important you should have 
    written it into your license.

See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#require for why I didn't
do that.  It isn't a legal requirement to give us credit for our work,
so why not do the right thing anyway?

This involves running Windows, which (being proprietary software)
gives the developer power over you.  It is full of back doors and
spyware.  It would be safer, and involve less proprietary software, to
run that app under Wine.  But even though Wine is free, if the app is
proprietary you are still under someone else's power -- in this case,
whoever wrote that application.

The real solution is to develop a free program to do the same job.
If you don't do this, who will?






This has as much relationship to CSAIL as the proposal for installing
fiber, so I refer people to

Is the operating system on your phone nonfree?  If so, it does not
provide security reliably.  The manufacturer puts malicious

could cancel the security with a malicious system downgrade.

  > What's the equivalent of Free software in algorithmic medicine?

The issue of how you do your computing, and the issue of how some
organization does computing that affects you, are fundamentally
different.  One can't expect to generalize specifics of the analysis
(let alone solutions) from one to the other.

The free software issue does relate to algorithmic medicine.  A clinic
or public health organization that does algorithmic medicine deserves
control of its computing, just as you and I do, just as CSAIl does.
So it should insist on carrying out the algorithm using free software,
its own copy, running on its own computer.

That is for the organization's sake.  Ethical treatment of patients is
a different matter.

We can't expect free medical software to assure good medicine, any
more than a free word processor assures good writing.  However, free
medical software gives the clinic control over the quality of the
medicine it does, so it can take responsibility for that.

Those are two different questions, about two different issues.

The second question says "black box".  A black box is a box you can't
look inside.  Metaphorically, that means you're not allowed to see
what the program does.  By definition, that is not free software.  The
developer may know full well what it does, but you are not allowed to
know.

The first question refers to a case where "nobody" can explain what
the program does.  This is not a black box; rather, it is something
difficult to understand.  Quite a different issue.

I hesitate to say that a program could be nonfree because its code is
so hard to understand that nobody can do it.  The distinction between
free and nonfree is supposed to be about who's permitted to do what.

What about when the program (or a part) has no source code in the
strict sense -- for instance, a trained neutral net?

If you can figure out what the neural net does by trying it on a bunch
of examples, maybe that is good enough for understanding it.  It is
also possible to modify a trained neural net in whatever way you wish
by doing further training.  Maybe that is good enough to make
modification a meaningful option.

That sounds like an argument for making a page on amazon.com about

The question I raised is, when you send people email, how to mention
your book in the email.

Have you got another page about your book?  If not, you can make one.
Then you could give that page in your email.

I don't think these problems are hard to address.  Modifying the
software can void the warranty if the modification is pertinent to the
accident.

As for the insurance companies, they can set their conditions, but the
car manufacturer does not have stop the car owner from violating them.

It is straightforward to set up the car systems so they record when
software is changed.  That way, those who have changed the software
will not be able to deny that they did, or when they did.

If the US uses such robots, I can envision it using this as

may not resist

Meanwhile, what is true for robot A will not necessarily be true for
robot B.  So really the question is not how much collateral damage and

If you want to publish some facts about you, you can do so in many ways.
You can state them in a web page.

However, systems _must not_ be designed to lead people systematically
to do this!

We have seen that most people will give up their personal data without
resisting hard, when a system demands it as the price for what they
want to do.  We have seen how, when such a system is accepted by some,
social pressures make it hard for others to refuse.  Consider the
fitbit, for example -- it gives personal data to a company.  At first,
it was easy to refuse to use a fitbit; but now some employers require
staff to use them.  Insurance companies may do it, too.

Consider how many "services" demand a price in privacy, and justify it
by saying "Nobody is compelled to use our service", and all the while
millions of people say "It's impossible to live without using that."

I conclude that if systems are designed so that surrendering personal
data is a condition of use, they will develop into aggressive attacks
on privacy.

Thus, we must demand that all systems be designed to collect as little
personal data is they possibly could.

I am living proof that it isn't literally impossible.  They are
exaggerating a little when they say so.  But not much.

The truth is, there is strong social and work pressure to use some of
those things.  If you are really strong-willed, and don't feel family
ties very strongly, you can reject them, though you may need to quit
your job.  However, most people can't conceive of standing up to that
pressure.

If we allow "services" that most people can't refuse to use to get
away with mistreatment by pleading "people don't have to use this",
we're deluding ourselves.

The simple heuristic, when a tiny fraction of the people in some large
city have been harmed, is to assume that everyone there you know is
ok.  It almost always works.  In the extremely unlikely case that it
fails, you will find out eventually.  In the mean time, you can avoid

I think these cases are quite different.  Your employer knows you and
has a reason to see your work emails.  However, another company has no
legitimate reason to know anything about your employment.

Thus, it is ok for company A to insist you have an account on ITS OWN
computers, but offensive for it to require you to have an account in
your own name at company B.

That question is important, but it is irrelevant to the issue at hand.
For this issue, the question is whether the system bears
responsibility for the choices it leads or pressures people to make.

Responsibility of the individual and responsibility of the system are
not exclusive.  For instance, people who are useds of Facebook bear
responsibility for that, and Facebook bears responsibility for it
too.

Your misunderstanding is that you think it is the same question.

There are two parties, the user and the system.  Thus, we can ask, is
the user responsible?  And we can ask, is the system responsible?  If
each answer must be "yes" or "no", there are 2*2 possible pairs of
answers.

Did you assume that only one of the two can bear responsiblity?

The system partly responsible, and therefore it makes sense to
regulate the system so that it does less harm.  We regulate many sorts
of businesses for that sort of reason, and that is one of the vital
functions of the state.

(In the Facebook case, it is even worse than that.  Facebook
does surveillance that most internet users don't even know about,
and have never been asked to agree to.)

This is one of the reasons why we need to defeat the TPP (propaganda
name, "Trans-Pacific Partnership") and other business-supremacy
treaties: because they would hamper the necessary regulation of
businesses.  Foreign businesses (not domestic businesses) would
be empowered to sue in a special business-supremacy court
whenever a regulation or law interferes with profit.

Even the earlier business-supremacy treaties, which don't allow
foreign businesses to sue directly, block democracy from achieving
important goals.

http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2015/11/20/world-trade-organization-puts-dolphins-risk

In this case, it was protecting wildlife, but it could just as easily
protect public health, level of competition, or levels of wages and
benefits.

We should abolish all business-supremacy treaties, but we are still
on the defensive.  We need to block the TPP, the TTIP, and the TISA.

If you have not done so, I urge you to contact your elected federal
officials to call for rejection of the TPP.  We must not put American
democracy in a trance.

I think the most important question is not who will hold the copyright
but whether the paper will be, or can reliably be, published under a
license that permits copying (ideally CC-BY).

It's possible that they were sincerely trying to help the conference
get "better" results, for a specific idea of "better" that you might have
disagreed with, if only you knew.  That often happens with lawyers.

For instance, often lawyers think their job is to put the client into
the strongest possible legal position -- that is, with the most weapons
to use against anyone else.  Clients may "follow legal advice" without
realizing that it's advice on how to achieve some particular assumed goal.

  > The IP itself

The term "intellectual property" is a generalization which is almost
always far too broad, and thus leads to incorrect statements.  The
issue here is specifically copyright; for clarity's sake, let's not
bring in a dozen other unrelated laws which, if they apply to this
stuation at all, would say totally different things about it.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html.

Unfortunately, MIT does object to certain licenses for software.
If you are working at MIT and MIT might claim copyright on your work,
please see http://gnu.org/philosophy/universities.html at the start

Please think about what license you want to use, which I hope will be

Ubuntu is a GNU/Linux distro, and GNU/Linux is basically a free/libre
operating system, but Ubuntu is not entirely free software.
See gnu.org/distros.

Even worse, Ubuntu spies on the user.  See
http://gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.html.  We should put all the
pressure we can on Ubuntu to get rid of the spyware.

Adding a minor insult to these serious injuries, the Ubuntu
distribution and associated materials refer to the operating system as
"Linux", which means giving no credit to the system's principal
developers: the GNU Project, which I started in 1984 as I resigned
from AI Lab employment.  Hundreds of people joined me in developing
GNU, and we had most of the system components working, before Torvalds
started working on the kernel, Linux.

Plagiarism has nothing to do with copyright.
Plagiarism is a kind of dishonesty, pretending to be
the author of something when you aren't.
If you submitted Chaucer's poetry as your own work, that would not be
copyright infringement (indeed they were NEVER copyrighted), but it
would still be plagiarism.

That's good, but then I can't follow your reasoning.

You repeat your premise that, if it is possible through heroic

the system does to those who are not heroic.

We've refuted that already.

It is unlikely they are fully informed.  By now, they surely know Facebook
snoops on them, but they probably don't know how much.

But it would not matter if they did.  We know that many users resent the
snooping but think that the pressure is too hard to stand up to.
In other words, they say that they are not in control.

  > Sub-heading from half-way down that article:

  > "Open Source Means More Than Free"

I guess that they are using "free" to mean "gratis".  Microsoft would
like people not to use the term "free software"; interfering with
understanding of the term is one of its PR goals.

I will see the article when my fetcher demon answers my request
for a copy.

In fact, the situation is the opposite: free software means more than
open source.

1. Free software grants practical freedom to users.
For instance, free software must allow users to make modified versions
and use them privately.  Open source programs do not necessarily
permit that.

It can be blocked by a license (some open source licenses are not free
licenses, for this reason), and it can be blocked via tivoization.
Tivoization means the hardware won't let modified versions function
properly.  In this case, the source code is free (and open source),
but the executable is not.

Due to Restricted Boot, this may be the case with Windows:
that the executables will be open source but not free.
People will see how inadequate that is.

See fsf.org/campaigns for info about Restricted boot.  But note that
Microsoft recently changed it for the worse: with Windows 10,
Microsoft has stopped insisting that PCs let users change the keys.
Some PCs may refuse to run anything but Microsoft's versions of Windows.
I think that change is not yet reflected in fsf.org.

2. Free software upholds freedom as a principle; open source eschews
principles.  It has a criterion to make a distinction, but it doesn't
relate that criterion to right or wrong.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.  See also http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler for
Evgeny Morozov's article on the same point.

    for much cheaper
    than human labor, and humans are free to spend their time on more
    interesting tasks while enjoying a higher standard of living supported
    by our robot slaves.

That world might be ok, but look around you: is that where we are headed?

We are in a world of "trickle down", where the owners of the robots
increasingly get all the robots produce.  The standard of living for
non-rich Americans is less than it was 40 years ago, despite a big
increase in productivity.

We know, from what we see around us, that if the taxi driver jobs
(either 1 million or 2 million in the US, I forget which) disappear,
those jobs will be replaced by a smaller number of minimum-wage jobs.

Will replacing taxis with driverless cars be safer?  I don't think so.

There are some 40,000 deaths a year due to traffic accidents in the
US, but only a small fraction of those are caused by taxi drivers,
since they drive better than most drivers.  Let's suppose it is 4,000
a year.

Now look at the million additional people who will be unemployed or
working at minimum wage, becuase they won't be taxi drivers.  They
will be living in poverty, and poverty kills.  What's their chance of
dying, each year, from poverty?  Suppose 1% (I think it is more).
That means 10,000 deaths per year.

Thus, I think the driverless cars will reduce, not increase,
society's safety.  To judge solely by car accidents is to
look at the positive and ignore the negative.

Will driverless cars be more efficient?  Yes, if reducing cost by
shedding employees is considered efficiency.  But this kind of
efficiency is a misguided goal in the US today.

It was a valid goal 50 years ago, when the limit on people's
well-being was production.  Back then, higher productivity meant more
total production, and resulted in increased wages for workers, while
employment remained high.

The main economic problem of the US today is not a scarcity of stuff;
it is the increasing concentration of income and wealth.  Many
Americans have trouble meeting basic needs such as medicine, food, and
a place to live.  Productivity of US workers has doubled in the past 3
decades or so, but wages (for those lucky enough to be employed) have
not increased.

Thus, increased productivity or efficiency in regard to workers' pay
is a misguided goal.

    I don't think this tells us whether Uber replacing drivers with
    robocars is more or less inevitable or immediate than yellow cab
    doing the same. I have no confidence that either cares about the
    welfare of the drivers, but I note that there are a few more laws
    protecting the cabbies.

I think Uber will be in a much better position to get the large
investment funds needed to buy so many robot cars.

    In any case, even granting that replacing human labor with mechanized
    labor can lead to unemployment and poverty, I don't think that means
    we should become Luddites; 

The Luddites opposed specific technology for weaving because of its
social effects.  To apply that term to today's situation, we have to
stretch it; it comes to mean that society should be selective about
which technologies to use.

Why shouldn't we be Luddites?  Technologies are not sacred.  They are
methods that we can use to do various things.

			       it just means technological advancement
    needs to be coupled with social reform, creating better safety nets
    for the poor and reducing inequalities in the distribution of wealth
    and goods.

I would be in favor of a plan to do both -- but that requires NOT
letting things take their course.  (We are on course to apply this
technology while not carrying out the social reform.)

    All of this is true, if you assume that robotic cars with a poor safety
    record will become road legal (and widespread) fast enough to displace all
    the existing taxi drivers before they have time to find new careers.

That has three obvious errors:

* I did not claim the robotic cars will be accident-prone.

* Americans that lose good jobs often don't find new careers.
Millions have dropped out of the labor market, having no hope of
finding work again.  Other millions have Mcjobs that are not careers.

* The issue is not limited to the people who are taxi drivers TODAY.
If robotic taxis become common 15 years from now, the people who are
taxi drivers 15 years from now will lose their jobs, and the people
who WOULD have been taxi drivers after that (20, 30, or more years
from now) will also have fewer good jobs and fewer total jobs
available to them.

    What is the advantage to choosing what technologies should be allowed to
    exist, or otherwise protecting old industries from new innovations? 

Regulation of use of technology is a way to avoid many sorts of harm
that affect people other than those who choose to put the technology
into use.

For instance, medicines are regulated.  Food processing is regulated.
Food service is regulated.  Pesticides are regulated (though not
strictly enough).  Many industrial processes are regulated.  Oil
drilling is regulated (though not strictly enough).  Cars are
regulated.  Radios are regulated.

Each of these kinds of regulation is for a specific important purpose.
There are others, too, that don't come to mind right now.

									 Who
    would get to choose?

I think we should make these decisions through democratic government,
like all the other regulatory decisions.

Reestablishing democratic government won't be easy, I admit.

I suspect FirefoxOS is shipped on computers that don't have enough
disk space for you to keep your files on them.  That would push you to
store them on a server -- which is a grave error if it isn't YOUR
server.  Does anyone here have empirical knowledge about whether this
is the case?

For people who don't have their own servers, such computers are a bad
thing no matter what software is running inside them.

I saw Chromebook a few days ago, and it was definitely of that sort.

I suspect that FirefoxOS computers also push people into using SaaSS
(service as a software substitute) instead of installing free programs
to do their own computing.  Does anyone here have empirical knowledge
about whether this is the case?

SaaSS is bad because it cedes control of your own computing.

    > SaaSS is bad because it cedes control of your own computing.

    The subject and object of this sentence are incorrectly swapped; code
    has no agency.

There was no error, and you figured out the meaning.  If you use
SaaSS, you cede control of your computing.

      Users of SaaSS cede control of their own computing --
    in voluntary agreement with Terms of Use.  

Yes, exactly.  Just as users of a nonfree program cede control
of their computing.

It is possible to reject SaaSS, just as it is possible to reject
nonfree software.  It requires going against lots of social pressure,
so many people perceive it as "impossible".  We can distinguish
two ways of denying that:

* Yes, it's possible.  You can do it!  We will help you do it.

* Yes, it's possible, you chose to take this path, so screw you.

      You may disagree with their
    choice, but that does not support the conclusion that SaaSS is
    inherently "bad".

  You may disagree with their choice, but that does not support the

The reason SaaSS is bad is that it denies people control of their

is another question.

    I see nothing wrong with storing my files on somebody else's
    servers or using a service somebody else has created.

I've pointed out how it subjects users to surveillance.
If you don't mind being surveilled, then you can ignore my message.

     SaaSS is designed to make people's lives 
    easier, and if I want to compromise some level of security to do that, it's my 
    choice.

This seems like a misunderstanding.  The harm done by SaaSS
is not in the area of security.  Rather, it means you lose
control over your own computing -- just as if you were
running a nonfree program.

Do read http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html,
to understand the issue.  You may not care about this imposed dependence,
but at least you'll know what issue you're not caring about.

    This doesn't make the Chromebook or the Firefox OS "bad" 
    for everyone,

The Chromebbook (and perhaps Firefox OS also) is are bad because when
people get these, they are essentially compelled thereafter to do
their computing in harmful ways.

     and no one is going to force you to use it.

For the moment, no.  But "big things" that take off tend to generate
powerful currents that sweep people along whether they like it or not.
Do you want to be able to buy a laptop that is a real computer
in 10 years?  If so, you had better push for it.  The "free market"
if today is one where companies shape people's "preferences" and herd them
where the companies want them to go.

    I will point out that almost everybody at CSAIL chooses to store at
    least some of their files on somebody else s servers -- CSAIL's.

If these files are for CSAIL's work, it's appropriate to store
them on CSAIL's servers.

    > The reason SaaSS is bad is that it denies people control of their
    > computing.

    Here again, the incorrect inversion of subject and object.  To hear
    you describe it, SaaSS would be sneaking into people's homes and
    migrating their processes to its own shadowy lair of cloud services.

You have picked a very narrow interpretation of that sentencea and used
it as a straw man.

    What you mean to say is "People who give their computing over to SaaSS
    are relinquishing their control"

Maybe that's what you mean to say.  What I mean to say is that SaaSS
as a practice has specific bad consequences toward the users of those
services.

      In this country, you can build your own house,...  and pull your
    own teeth; is it unethical or anti-freedom for others to offer to
    perform these same services for you?

Those physical activities are not a good analogy because they offer no
method comparable to doing them by running a free program.  Thus, we
have to choose between mastering the fields in question, or hiring others.
What's more, these others usually can't mistreat us in as many ways
as the operator of SaaSS can.

    My intent with apps for Firefox OS (and later for HTML 5 apps in 
    general) is that they work like traditional microcomputer application 
    programs: that they can work standalone on the device, do not require 
    network access artificially, and by default store any data on the device 
    itself.  Any backup and syncing can be to the user's other devices, via 
    USB or WiFi, without involving any outside service unnecessarily.

In that case, they might be ok.  It partly depends whether the external
memory is slow or tends to drop off or bang into other things as you carry
it around.  You could tape it on and connect it by extender cable,
if you really want to, but few will do that.

The person who had a Chromebook seemed to think it wasn't usable
except with servers, but the two products might not be similar.

    [*] One risk -- other than that not enough people pay -- is that someone 
    will use your GPL'd software to develop and sell a better version in the 
    same app store.

In the Ithing case, that would be a GPL violation:
Apple forbids GPL-covered software in its app store.

For this very reason, I would not want my program to be available in
the app store.  That would mean distributing a nonfree executable to
people who can't install the free version.  It would be no better,
for ithing users who can't or don't dare jailbreak, than any other
nonfree program.

Is there anyone here that has access to FirefoxOS and would like
to report on what it can do without a network connection?

(I've been using a 64G or bigger disk in my laptop for about a decade,
and assumed that others would want so much space too, so they would
need a USB storage device or would be driven to store the data
elsewhere; but maybe I'm mistaken in generalizing this to others.)

    I mostly agree, but it's the end users who get to decide whether those
    consequences are good or bad (or "worth it") -- not you or I.

    You're saying that it's reasonable to allow others to hire you to
    perform services in a field that you've taken the time to master,
    unless that field was computer science

No, I said that if you use a service which does your own computing,
you lose control of that computing, and it's equivalent to running a
nonfree program which is spyware and has a back door.  So if you value
your freedom, you need to reject it.

Comparing this with other areas of activity is an interesting
question, but you must be prepared to find that the right conclusions
are not the same in all areas.

    SaaSS describes all paid services that use software on the backend.
    To make your argument, you are pretending that all SaaSS instances
    have a free alternative of equal quality (including ease of use) --
    that no SaaSS instances are the product of anyone's individual
    expertise or time.

You've misrepresented his arguments.  You often do that.

    I hesitated to respond to this, because it sounds like you're saying
    that just because a program is easy to copy and distribute, the writer
    of that program is somehow depriving you of something by not giving
    you the product of their experience (and labor) at no cost.

Some people may say that.  I don't say that the developer is obligated
to give you a copy.

What I say is that it is wrong for the developer of the program (or
anyone) to stop me (assuming I have a copy) from making another copy
and giving it to you.

    Isn't SaaSS precisely that first part? The developer writing some
    software and then letting you make use of its functionality
    without giving you a copy of the code?

Actually, no.  SaaSS is when a server does a job you could do in your
own computer with the right program.  It's SaaSS to use that server,
even if you have the source of all the software in it -- because you
can't control how that server does your computing if the server isn't
yours.

I think we're talking about two different things at once.  I was
responding to a different thread, about a scenario which (as far as I
can tell) doesn't involve a server.

    We should consider, as many of our machine-learning friends know well,
    that some services are useful precisely because they have the ability
    to aggregate data across many thousands (or millions) of users, which
    is not "a job you could do in your own computer with the right
    program", even if they gave you the exact software that they are using
    under a free license.

You're right, for that kind of activity.  An activity in which many
people submit data to be integrated is a joint activity, not a
personal activity of any one.  The issue of SaaSS in its simplest
(personal) form doesn't apply to joint activities.

However, using services for those joint activities can raise other
ethical issues.  For instance, using Google Docs to share drafts with
a few other people in an ad-hoc group is not SaaSS (the service
functions as kind of repository), but it snoops on all of you and
requires non-free client-side software.

By contrast, using Google Docs to _edit_ the shared draft _is_ SaaSS,
because you could do that with a program in your own computer.

    I think the social good provided by disseminating knowledge among peers
    (e.g. via a service like learnto) is much greater in magnitude than the
    social "bad" that is generated by giving a small amount of money to Amazon.

That's an irrelevant question.  The right comparison is between promoting
learnto with amazon gift certificates and promoting it in some other way.

I don't know anything about learnto, but if it is a commercial web
service, several possible problems occur to me.  For instance, what
personal information does it collect about users?  Does it require
running nonfree Javascript code?

Is it good for this sort of interaction (one-on-one teaching)
to be channeled through a commercial web site?

     But it's also very hard not to use Amazon.
    With most physical stores going out of business (Best Buy, Borders etc.) ,

There are still physical bookstores, including the MIT Coop which is

reachable by train or bus.  Both of these stores will order books for

    I'm very happy with the reading* and browsing experience on the Nook Color

    * DRM aside, of course, but a substantial fraction of what I read on it
    is DRM free,

Those words suggest that most of your use of the machine is afflicted
with DRM.  Should the "substantial fraction" that is free of DRM
excuse that?  I don't think so.

If you give DRM an inch, it will take a mile.  Thus, if we don't want
DRM to rule us, we must fight it at every inch.  The first, most basic
counterattack is to reject it.  That means, never buy readers with
DRM, and never buy books with DRM.

The lockdown of the Nook Tablet makes it nastier.  It means that even
if we could write free drivers for the machine, we could not install a
free system.  However, we are very far away from having the
information to write the needed free drivers.  Thus, in terms of the
possibility of liberating it, the Nook Color is effectively just as
bad.

An announcement says there will be a sales presentation in our
building on Dec 6 for a program whose description says it is
"available for FREE to the academic...community".  This suggests it is
non-free software and that you wouldn't be allowed to redistribute it
to your non-academic friends or the public.  They say it comes with
"model source code", which suggests that the real source code of their
program is not available.

I wish I could go to the event and raise these issues, and discourage
people from accepting it.  However, I won't be back until late in the
evening that day.  Is there anyone else who would like to go there and
raise these issues?  Please respond to me if so, and we can discuss
it further privately.





    There is no one person in charge of the hvac issues. We report the 
    problems and then mit facilities along with sub contractors do their 
    best to address each issue.

Having no specific responsible person sounds like a recipe for a bad
job.  Perhaps the lesson is that to get good results, we need to change
the system which is delivering bad results.




    They are also vital if we want the Bush tax cuts to be sustainable.

Only the fatcats who benefit from these tax cuts have a reason to wish
them to be sustained.




Shame on Friedman to speak of forcing "reform" on Venezuela.  The US
already tried in 2002 to overthrow the elected government there, but
failed.  This year it won by large margins in two elections.

Venezuela is already taking the path of reform--using the oil windfall
for medical care and education to the poor.  Bush doesn't like that,
because he wants the oil companies to get the windfall.  This, plus
some loose change such as the DMCA, is the "reform" he would like to
impose in Venezuela--similar in spirit to his "reform" in the US.

When the US government is as democratic, as freedom-loving, and as
peaceful as that of Venezuela, it will be legitimate to encourage the
US to try to contribute to reform there.  Today our hope must be that
Venezuela can bring about reform here.









     I think the other people, who benefit from the taxcuts, besides the
    fatcats, also have a reason to wish this sustainability.

These tax cuts provide large benefits only to fatcats.
They provide small benefits to many others, so Bush could
claim that the cuts benefit many, but they aren't enough
for people to fight over.

What they did to you is bad, but understandable.  They were compelled
by the situation to screw either you or someone else.  I am sure they
would have preferred to accommodate everyone, but it was impossible.

There is something else, worse, that hotels in NYC do to ALL guests:
they demand to see a photo ID, and register it in a data base.  This
is not a big inconvenience; it is worse than an inconvenience, because
it subjects you to surveillance.

The hotels' management is not to blame for this: NYC law requires them
to do this, so the NYC government is to blame.  But that doesn't make
the practice any more acceptable.  I would never stay in a hotel in NYC.

software but in a superficial practical way while avoiding the issues
of freedom.  (See http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler for more
explanation.)

Since I think the freedom issues are centraly, I will use the term
"free software" and shun "open source".

You've pointed out that these "services" tend to require users to run
non-free Javascript programs.  I think you're also saying that even if
the server code is free, that is not very helpful since users need a
server if they want to run it.

I think these are two very different issues, since one involves being
a user of the service, and the other involves setting up your own
service.  They are both important issues, but distinguishing them
is necessary for understanding them.

We are trying to pressure sites to make their JavaScript code free
through the LibreJS program (see gnu.org/software/librejs), but that
is just the first step.  We also need to make it easy for users to
develop and use their modified versions of that JavaScript code with
the sites.  GreaseMonkey is somewhat like this, but don't do exactly
what is needed.

Your idea of a standard way to open a file on a remote web site could
be progress -- especially if it is available in various programming
platforms, so you don't have to access the site only through browsers
and program only in Javascript.  However, in order to reach an
acceptable result, in terms of freedom, this has to be _instead_ of
running the site's nonfree Javascript on your machine, not _based on_
running the site's nonfree Javascript.

However, I don't follow how this relates to the issue of running free
server-side code on your own server.  How do they relate?


Meanwhile, let's not forget the bigger issues raised by these same
scenarios.  What data are you putting on that site, and why?  Did you
encrypt it before uploading it?  If not, you're handing it over to the
NSA.  Did you identify yourself to that site?  If so, you are enabling
the NSA to track you.

Don't let them put you in Prism!  Don't keep your data, or your copies
of anything published, in a service that clouds the responsibility for
your privacy.  Keep it under your personal control, except for
occasional backups that you encrypt on your own machine before storing
them anywhere else.

    Why do you hold the company (and not the individuals) accountable?

I am just a supporter of this boycott, not a leader.  However, in
general it is a good idea to hold both companies and their specific
employees responsible for wrongdoing, unless the company works hard
to prevent and stop the wrongdoing.

    I agree with your sentiment, but you've oversimplified the equation to
    "hurting Coke = helping workers", which is wrong to the point of being
    harmful.

I think the simplification comes from you, not from me.

I support the boycott because of the murder of union organizers.  The
workers in Colombia ask for our support in the form of boycotting the
company internationally.  I suggest we support them by not stocking
the machine with Coca Cola products.

If you want to propose some alternate action, and you are prepared to
do the work of organizing it, we could consider supporting it, but
unless you have a brilliant idea it will be more effective to support
the existing campaign which has momentum.

If you don't propose some alternate action, your argument is "This is
not ideal, so let's do nothing."

    My argument is "actions of this type have been shown to be more
    detrimental than inaction, so let's not take take this action".  This
    is based on the evidence I presented: that boycotts and sanctions can
    cause serious harm to the people they are intended to help;

The union organizers in Colombia asked for this boycott.  They believe
international pressure on Coca Cola Company will help them, and I
think they know better than you.

    The question you should be asking is: who allowed paramilitary forces
    to harm these unionists?

The Colombian government, supported by the US government, encouraged
the paramilitaries.  The paramilitaries are gangsters that don't
hesitate to kill whenever it suits them.  But the only motive
they have to murder union organizers is a reward from the company.

			      If Coca-cola is really the source of the
    problem, what stops them from employing such paramilitary tactics in
    this country?

I don't know, but conditions in the US are rather different from
conditions in Colombia.  Perhaps Coca Cola executives in the US don't
think they could get away with literal murder.  Perhaps they will
close their eyes to murder in Colombia but to not murder in the US.
There are other possibilities too.  The question is not crucial; we
don't need to know the answer.

    In all honesty I think the #1 thing we can do as a society of leaders
    to support public transportation is to actually USE it.

Many of us already do use it.  However, it can't run on fares alone
unless the fares are too high for poor people.  We need to subsidize
it more, also.

    and/or host meetings with large numbers of people at public-transit
    inaccessible destinations.

It seems that the NSA may in some cases actually look at people's
email if they use encryption.  This means we have a choice:

We can let the NSA intimidate us into surrendering one of the ways we
can protect or privacy, with a threat so weak it is hardly a threat at
all.

Or we can stand firm, and spread the use of encryption to the point
where it is something everybody does.

Remember, even if you don't use encryption, they still might look at
your records.  (They might look because you received mail from me.)
And even if you do use encryption, they probably won't look much for
that reason alone.  You have to work hard to be scared of this.

With just a tiny drop of courage, you can shrug this off, and choose
the course that gives human rights a chance of winning.

    I'm confused how it's really understandable, since their system should not
    be set up to allow double booking of a room.

>From the info in her message, it is clear the hotel staff believed
they have an obligation to allow a guest to stay on for some amount of
time past the time the guest was supposed to leave.  I can't tell from
the info given whether it is a legal obligation or just their idea of
what they ought to do.

I can envision cases where making a guest leave on schedule is just as
bad as what happened to Lori.  For instance, suppose your flight out
of NYC gets cancelled and you're stuck there for another day but your
hotel kicks you out.

    Most countries require a passport from foreigners, difference here
    is that they also want one from locals, probably because it's hard
    to tell foreigners apart from locals in NYC. It's probably crime
    in general and not just terrorism.

I was told it was an "anti-terrorist" measure.  You can probably check
this by finding the announcement, which I believe was in the early
2000s.

It would make no sense as an anti-crime measure: Hotel guests commit
very little street crime.  Some of them participate in large financial
crimes, but the US lets them get away with those.

    Dr. Stallman - Thank you for your personal opinion. Unfortunately,
    we have spent a lot of funding/labor in the app and cannot afford
    releasing the source code.

That statement is a nonsequitur: to release the source code does not
cost anything, and the money and time you've spend are not necessarily
an obstacle.

Writing the GNU C Compiler involved a lot of work, but that did not
stop me from making it free software.  Nor is spending money.
Companies have spent substantial money on the development of GCC,
which doesn't conflict with its being free software.

In addition to the general ethical issue that applies to all software
that is released somehow -- it must respect users' freedom
(http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html) --
there's the additional issue that you're asking people to cooperate
with you while not cooperating with us.

In issues of free vs proprietary software, economic factors do exist,
but they have their consequences through the framework of the ethical
issue: a nonfree program treats users unjustly.

For instance, it can happen that for economic reasons it does not
appear possible at present to pay people to write a certain program
and release it as free software.  If so, what is the next best option?

The ethical options available include at least these three:

1. Write the program in spare time as a volunteer;
   it will get done more slowly, but it will respect freedom when done.

2. Look for a foundation or philanthropist to fund it as free software.

3. Do without that program.

To develop a nonfree program is unethical, so it is worse than any of
those ethical options.  When users' freedom is taken into account, a
nonfree program is worse than no program at all.

    For a commercial business, that's just not accurate.

I won't deny that businesses often find it profitable to make software
nonfree.  (Not that profit can excuse the practice.)

However, this was announced as an MIT activity, not a commercial
business activity.  Is MIT acting like a company?  Is a business
passing itself off as MIT?  If MIT got funds by agreeing to privatize
the results, that in itself was wrong,

Arguments about businesses aren't directly relevant to this case, but
that doesn't mean they are valid for businesses.  Here are some
dubious premises in them.

    * The risk that a competitor company will use your code to try to beat
    you in the marketplace.

If you release your code under the GNU GPL, that company would be required
to make its changes available for you, too.

    * The reputation and cost risk that a security vulnerability will be
    discovered and exploited because of the availability of source code.

In practice, free software's security is pretty good.  This is a
theoretical argument that there ought to be a drawback, which in
practice is not observed.

    * The risk that a patent troll will identify a portion of the code
    they believe covered by a patent and sue, incurring huge legal costs.

Patent trolls and other patent agressors don't need to see source
code.  Simply seeing the program in operation is generally enough for
them.

    What if we have a potential app which can do a large amount of good (saving
    lives, world peace, greatly improving the average quality of life, etc.)

If the program is so useful, we should develop it and release it as
free software.  If some functionality is important for people, they 
should not have to trade their freedom for it.

If the program is so useful, we can raise funds for it using crowdfunding
and then pay people to write a free program fast.

Skype is a very good example.  It is wrong even to suggest using
Skype, because that means pressuring someone else to use Skype.

Medical NGOs try to stop infections from spreading.  Use of a nonfree
program such as Skype is a kind of infection, cultural and
computational rather than medical.  I don't think curing one infection
justifies spreading another.  You should take precautions to avoid
that.

Skype is not necessary, merely convenient.  They have plenty of
alternatives.  In addition to phones, and Ekiga, there is also
ordinary email which uses far less bandwidth.

You cite Skype's network effect, but what does it imply?  You presume
it implies that everyone should surrender to Skype -- in effect,
arguing that if an infection is widespread we should not try to cure
or prevent it.  I conclude rather that each of us has a special duty
to resist it.

When you say that switching to Ekiga would have "high practical cost
with no practical benefit", that's simply a way of setting the value
of freedom at zero.

The decision of whether to use or develop a particular nonfree
program, when viewed from a short-term perspective, looks like a
choice between a proprietary program or no program.  (I wouldn't use
the proprietary program.)

In the long term, however, the real choice is between a proprietary
program and a free program.  If society is lazy and allows itself to
be herded, the proprietary program will become established and will
develop more; users will cite that as a reason not to escape from the
corral.  If society refuses to be herded, it can arrange for the
development of the free program.  Once the free program catches on, it
will develop more.

One idea is to get a small plastic whistle, put a photo of Snowden on
one round side, and the message "IN CASE OF CONSTITUTION VIOLATION,
BLOW WHISTLE" on the other round side, and give it to them as a gift.

In any case, it would be good for people to spend a couple of hours
protesting there with signs this afternoon.  Don't worry too much
about the details, it's better to do anything nonviolent than do
nothing.

    If making different groups bid against each other is wrong,

You've taken my rather specific statement and stretched it into
something much broader that I did not say.  (I think you've done that
before.)

I am not talking about bidding as such.  I am talking about having
individuals bid against each other for nonprofessional work.  It is
harmful because it undermines the minimum wage.

It is usually a good thing for the government to get the lowest
possible price.  That mainly reduces the owners' and executives'
profit.  However, if those that hire individuals get the lowest
possible price, it will tend to benefit the wealthy (that do the
hiring) and impoverish the poor (that get low pay this way).
That's the opposite of what our society needs.

    > I am talking about having

    In that case, your ire was misplaced -- the individuals who choose to
    bid below the minimum wage are what you have a problem with, not the
    app in question.

You've got plenty of gall, but I think I know my position
better than you do.

I don't know those people's motivation.  Some may be egoistic and lack
solidarity; some may be underemployed and desperate.  In any case,
they are acting within a social system, following a path created by
that site.  Unfortunately, that path will lead to less income for poor
people in general, making more people more desperate.

Each person is responsible for her personal choice to take that path,
but the system which created that path is also responsible.  And where
the persons may plead the excuse of desperation, the site's owner
can't.

It is hard to convince egoists to feel more solidarity with others.
It is straightforward to make desperate people less desperate, but it
is not easy -- it takes a lot of money, or legislation.  In this case,
the easiest way to reduce future desperation is to get rid of the site.

    I'm not sure whether this is an act of willful ignorance, but the
    "very poor working for the very rich" is not the only use case for
    placing a low monetary value on one's time.

It's a harmful case that reportedly is happening a lot.
It is important because it can potentially do a lot of harm.
Whether it is the "only case" is simply beyond the point.

At any rate, bidding low prices to do non-lifesaving jobs for
strangers is not volunteering, and can't be altruism.
Those are red herrings.

    Your attitude could go a long way toward preventing the prices of
    various services from being lowered within financial reach of anyone
    who cannot already afford them.

I can't stop it because it is not a real possibility.  Poor people
generally don't have smartphones or credit cards; often they can't
get bank accounts, so they have to use check-cashing companies.

Poor people do pay each other and barter for small jobs.  They make
these deals with people in their neighborhoods.  They don't need
a web site to make those deals.

    If this is true, why would you say that can they be negatively
    affected by a smartphone app that pays people electronically?

I had a feeling you would say that.  It looks so logical, if you
ignore the substance.  It makes a peculiar assumption:

   If a person can't use that site, he has not been doing such jobs
   in the past.

Since the current methods of getting hired for such jobs don't use a
smartphone, the people who currently do them don't need one.  If a new
system makes them need one, that alone will be an expensive burden on
them.

The older systems ways of finding people to do these jobs may involve
employes who are paid at least minimum wage.  If this site replaces
such employment with bidding smaller amounts, the workers will get
much less.

We should not judge a Microsoft research center (or any other
company's research center) without considering the danger that the
research will lead to patents that will threaten everyone in the
computing field.

University work is not automatically safe from this -- I hope you have
all made sure that your work won't result in any computational idea
patents -- but it is harder in a company.

The only exceptions are companies such as Twitter and Tesla
that have firm policies of using patents defensively only.

    Meteor is open source software under the MIT license.

There are two different licenses sometimes called "the MIT license",
so it is better to avoid using that term.  However, both are free
licenses.  (See http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html.)
Thus, it follows that Meteor is free software.

That's good.  Happy hacking.

The futon is the elementary particle of the hack field.  If you have
succeeded in isolating a futon, have you measured its properties?  For
instance, what is its mass?  Did you ever experience a magnetic moment
on it and get a real charge?  Does it appear strange?  Does it have
charm?  Has it been slepton?

If you intend to sell the futon, I think you ought to tell potential
buyers what its half-life is, and what it decays into.  Pillows and
sheets?  Some nearly massless bedbugs?

If it's a stable futon, what kind of animals were using it, and did
they associate any dark matter with it?

    Your assumption is also strange -- that people would switch to a new
    employer that pays them less to do the same job.  You could justify
    that by making an additional assumption: that the app will change the
    industry to the point where the existing jobs begin to disappear
    (forcing workers to switch employers and buy smartphones).

Yes, that is the scenario I am concerned about.  I don't know whether
it will happen in this field, but we can't rule it out.  We have seen
such changes in other areas of business.

    But as you pointed out in a previous email, the practice of selling
    one's time for less than minimum wage is alive and well:

    > Poor people do pay each other and barter for small jobs.  They make
    > these deals with people in their neighborhoods.  They don't need
    > a web site to make those deals.

We don't know whether they are paying effectively less than minimum
wage.  Perhaps sometimes yes and sometimes no.  When it is barter, or
a relationship of mutual two-way cooperation, that question may not
have a meaningful answer.

Cooperation in personal relationships among poor people coexists with
companies where some of those people get paid wages (at least minimum
wage) to do similar jobs for nonpoor clients.  For example, people
sometimes make food for a neighbor's family in return for some other
favor, and some people are paid as cooks.

If employment as a cook is replaced by bid-low-for-each-dish web site,
the people who now work as cooks will get paid less.  Cooperation
among poor people will continue, neither better nor worse.  So they
will in general be worse off overall.

The recognition that recommending a nonfree program is not quite right
indicates a step forward in ethical awareness of users' freedom.  It
is a sign of progress.  With a further next step forward, people might
decide to refrain from recommending them at all.

Please note that commercial software is not the same thing as nonfree
software.  Nonfree software is software that doesn't respect users'
freedom.  Commercial software is software connected with a company.
Most commercial programs are nonfree, but there are exceptions, free
commercial programs.  (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html.)

Ethically, what matters is whether the program is free or not.  Being
connected with a company is not, in itself, a bad thing.

Linux alone is not sufficient to run such a program.

    Seems like the software to generate a mosaic/bitmap is the easy
    part ? or already exists in ImageMagick?

Fine Roman mosaics don't have square stones.  Each stone has a shape
chosen to suit the goal.  Perhaps they were chosen from among the
stones available, but it would be nice to be able to cut a stone to
fit a certain spot and make things look good.  The stones are small,
sometimes only 5mm across.

I think that artists would want to design these shapes this by hand.
So the program would be to aid the artist, not to rasterize.
However, maybe a clever program could suggest what to do.

It sounds like there is a company that already has a robot to make
mosaics.  (I guess that means my idea was a good one.)  I wonder if
they can do this level of quality.

    my experience is that when I did it ACM rejected the amendment and 
    refused to publish the paper until i submitted an unchanged agreement.

This is why MIT should make it a requirement rather than a
recommendation.  If ACM conferences could not publish papers from MIT,
it would change its policy.

There was a proposal to ask many authors of papers for a conference to
join together to demand free publication of their papers, giving the
ACM a last-minute choice of yielding or cancelling the conference.

    I have looked into this, and the parking office is adamant about
    prohibiting bicycles from the ramp and the garage.  It's unfortunate
    for us, but MIT wants to be on the safe side on this issue since
    Cambridge regulations does not officially allow bicycles to use
    our ramp.

Would it be feasible to bring a bicycle down to the garage in an
elevator?  That way they could be stored in the garage without using
the ramp.  Perhaps a bicycle storage area could be built around
an elevator door, with a fence around it containing a turnstyle that
people can pass through but not bicycles.  Maybe that would convince
these fear-obsessed bureaucrats.

When bureaucrats obstruct something necessary, often that means more
public pressure needs to be put on them until they bend.  The pressure
can be put on the Cambridge City Council as well, until they make an
arrangement with each other.  Neither of them wants to be seen as
pressuring people to drive cars rather than ride bikes.  The citizens
of Cambridge do not like their city government to do anything that
increases car traffic.

Brazil offers a gratis tax filing application, but it is not free

it.

Is the one in Australia free software?  If not, I hope that Australian
free software activists do the work to replace it.

We can avoid helping Intuit do that by not suporting it in any way.
(This is, of course, secondary to the acute issue of using nonfree
software, which I think also arises here.)

Once you see how they handle your return, you can use the same method
yourself.  However, that's a side issue.

The main issue is, you are presenting a short-term view of the issue.
You described the choices you have this year, and the advantages they
offer this year.

This begs the long-term question which someone else raised: why are
these particular choices available and not others?  Apparently Intuit
uses the money it gets from customers like you to turn the US
government to its own ends, and against the interests of Americans.
It seems that Intuit has Americans over a barrel to some extent.  That
is sleazy.

The sleazy control is not 100%.  (I don't use Turbotax, simply because
it is proprietary software.  I do my own tax returns, and the hard
part is getting the data ready, so I have no reason to stop.)

However, it's sleazy for a company to lobby the government to hold
people back, even when it doesn't amount to total monopoly.
I propose that we lower our general level of tolerance for that
sort of behavior.

We have all failed together.  The responsibility to bring about

  > On the software front, it would be sufficient to have access to the code.

That's not enough basis to trust a program.  Users need to have
control of it; merely being able to _look at_ the source code is not
sufficient.  When looking, you might see malfeatures, or mere bugs
that shaft you; if you can't fix them, then the program doesn't obey
you.

There is also the possibility that the "source code" they show you
is not exactly the source code of what is running.

I think you have misunderstood the term "open source" in the way most
people do.  In fact, open source requires a lot more than just
being allowed to see the source code.  Its definition is pretty close
in practice to that of free software.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for full explanation.

Free software gives uses control over their computing -- a sort of
autonomy.  Autonomy and security are not the same, and it's important
to see what the relationship is (and what it isn't).

Given control over your computing, security does not automatically
follow.  Maintaining high security, sufficient to keep out a
determined attacker, is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible.
Maintaining pretty good security, which will keep out most attackers,
is hard but one can do it.

However, without control over your computing, you can't even try to
maintain security.  Free software is a precondition for any level of
security, since any nonfree software provides zero security against
its developer.  In particular, Intel's nonfree software in the ME
provides zero security against Intel.

Autonomy is separate from security, and the two are important
for different reasons.

Consider a 1970 car, for example.  As owner of such a car, you are
free to change anything in it (though the car must meet roadworthiness
and pollution requiremnts).  You can repair or replace the body, the
engine, the steering, even the brakes.  You have full autonomy.

But it gives you no security, except against digital attacks.  There
is nothing in the ordinary 1970 car to stop someone from planting a
bomb in it, or tampering with the brakes.  It was not designed to
resist sabotage at all.  The autonomy gives you the possibility of
checking for sabotage, but no more.

Most drivers don't bother to check, since they rationally suppose no
one wants to sabotage them; but if you want to do such checking, you
need a car that have control over.

The claim that free software does no good since it doesn't guarantee
perfect security is fallacious because the autonomy of free software
is important for other reasons.

Another fallacy is the insistance on perfect security, as if anything
less than perfect were equivalent to nothing.

To try to stop people from using an empty conference room would be
gratuitous regimentation.  When the resource is unused, people should
use it if it is useful.

Someone suggested,

    Before you use this room, please check to see if it is reserved at:  https://calendar.csail.mit.edu/mrbs/

    If the room is available, please reserve it for your use.

There are two things wrong with this:

1. Inconvenience: you'd have to go somewhere you can log in, reserve it, and come
back.

2. Mistreatment: your use of the room would be tracked in a data base.

There is no need, no justification for either one.  I would urge
people to defy such a rule in the name of freedom.

That's what I would do -- especially since I can't reserve a room
since I don't have a CSAIL account.

That solution represents a value judgment: "We would rather be

If a group of people are expecting to use the room for a meeting,
and one or two people are using the room for something else,
it seems to me that the one or two people really ought to move
elsewhere even if the group forgot to make a reservation.

This is because the one or two people could do their activity in lots
of other places, while the larger group would find that hard to do.

That said, I have nothing against the plan to display schedules in the
rooms.

That may be the case in your crowd, but in my experience, people using
the term "cloud" usually mean other things.

The term "cloud" is used for many different meanings because it is
very nebulous.

But if we focus on the practice you are talking about, there are
details which vary.  These detauls make the service more or less
respectful of the freedom of users.  To use the term "fungible
computrons" is to disregard these differences a priori.

This sort of a-priori neglect is exactly what's wrong with the term
"cloud".

The term has several common usages -- the one you call "the common
usage" is one among them.

Once we see how other people use a term, we have a decision to make:
we can follow their usage, reject it, or even criticize it.  Our
opinion of the term is relevant to our actions, and our actions make
a difference.

In the 1980s I did not like the way the media had come to use the word
"hacker" as a synonym for "security breaker".  Rather than suppose
that whether I liked it was irrelevant, I launched a campaigne to
change it, with some success: our older meaning has made a comeback.
"Hackerspaces" are now to be found around the world.  "Hackathons"
develop useful software and other things.

People told me that this was hopeless and advised me to give up, but I
didn't.  I won't give up on educating people about "cloud" either.

Servers are not all equivalent, legally or socially, and their use is
not fungible.  You can disregard the differences, but they are real
nonetheless.

Car owners have maintained their own cars for as long as cars have
existed.  They work on the engines, the transmissions, the steering,
and the brakes, as well as the tires.  The fact that flaws in these
systems could cause a crash has never been seen as a reason to lock
them down and forbid the owners to change them.

Yet many people take for granted that software in the car should be
restricted in a way that the brakes are not.

Most companies think it is not in their interest to make free
software, if they expect we will accept nonfree software.  By not
accepting that, we can sometimes convince them to free it.  If not, we
have to write free replacement software.

However, sometimes hardware companies do release free software
since they make their money from selling the hardware.  Cars
are hardware.

I think Amazon deserves to be criticized for all the bad things it
does.  There are so many (listed in http://stallman.org/amazon) that
we have far more than enough reason to reject the company.
Mistreatment of warehouse staff is one of the many.  Even if you cast
out that one, the rest more than suffice.

If other companies are also mistreating warehouse staff, they deserve
criticism too.

I think you are attributing to Amazon the convenience benefits of
digital technology and the internet.  Amazon does not deserve credit
for them.  What Amazon did is leverage them for an unjust scheme.

For instance, the Amazon Swindle is a channel for e-books to be
available, but attacks readers' traditional freedoms: to read a book
privately; to lend, give or sell a book after reading it; to keep a
book as long as they wish.  See http://stallman.org/ebooks.pdf.

I personally will get no benefit ever from the existence of the
Swindle, since I will not cede any of those freedoms.

I do not think it is a benefit to society, to make something more
conveniently available by denying people freedom in using it.  Rather,
I think that is damage to society.

  > Competition between sellers keeps prices low, allowing low-income families
  > to get much more for their dollar (example:  my parents).

Low-income families generally spend nearly all their money on rent,
food, transportation, heat, and medical care.  The possible savings
from internet purchasing on the remaining small fraction of their
purchases cannot amount to much.

However, the other side of those low prices can hit them hard.  Since
the lower prices of e-retailing is achieved by eliminating lots of
jobs in or relating to local stores, lots of low-income families
suffer as a result.

Thus, this supposed benefit is really a form of dooH niboR.

In the past, when jobs were eliminated by improved technology, people
could get other jobs.  What's more, workers could get higher pay when
they were more productive.  Not any more.  The real unemployment rate
(including people who have given up trying to find work) remains high,
and nearly all the jobs created in the US since the crisis are
low-wage jobs.

As for competition, the crucial point about Amazon is that it is a
partial monopoly which conveys some of the power of a monopoly.  (The
same was true of Microsoft.)  Amazon can commit some of its abuses
precisely because it is restrained so little by competition.

On-line reviews are useful, but we did not need Amazon (or any partial
monopoly on sales) to have on-line reviews.

Order-fulfillment operations are useful, but they could be useful
without mistreating their workers, and without being a partial
monopoly.

You're talking about the FSF's boycott of Amazon, 15 years ago.  We
called the boycott because Amazon actually threatened a competitor
using that patent.

We think it is legitimate, given that computational idea patents are
issued, to obtain such patents and use them only for defense
(self-defense or collective defense).  The point where we condemn the
patent holder is when it uses them for aggression, as Amazon did.

I can't argue with what you say, but I don't think it is a big enough
advance for society to justify the harm that Amazon does.

Anyway, that that harm isn't inherently necessary for the good result.

If you are selling printed books, that is not bad in itself.  But all
that requires is SOME store, not one that does the other bad things
Amazon does.

You don't inherently need the store to track the buyers of your book.
Setting up a system to sell and ship physical objects to anonymous
buyers is not straightforward; I don't see a way someone could start a
small business to do that.  But it could be done by a society
concerned about privacy rights.

If you are selling Swindle ebooks, that's a very different issue --
because those are a direct attack against readers' human rights.  That
way of selling books should be illegal.  See stallman.org/ebooks.pdf.

Meanwhile, it IS possible to set up a store to sell ebooks ethically.
You could take payment in digital coin to allow the download via tor.
The anonymity will be more reliable once GNU Taler (taler.net) is working.

Please don't use Ustream.  It has a fatal ethical problem: it requires
nonfree software to view the stream.

It may be gratis, but it isn't free software.

Skype and Google Hangouts also require nonfree software.

Gratitude to the free software community is a common motive for
releasing free software.  Would you like to show gratitude to the
thousands of us who have developed free software, by releasing your
app's source under the GNU GPL?

Would you like to help our cause by urging users to do that too?

You can show your gratitude to readers, writers, bookstore owners and
workers, and warehouse workers, by not giving out Amazon gift cards.

Rather than saying "free as in beer", it's clearer to say "gratis".
That word is unambiguous and everyone knows it.

Then I reserve the word "free" for freedom; but you can add the word
"libre" to make that clearer.

It is not ethical treatment of the users, to put free programs

"Gratis for academic use" is nonfree.
Redistributing nonfree software is unethical too.

In your previous message you said they were distributing a gratis

service of installing free software is entirely legitimate; putting it
into a nonfree bundle is wrong.  The latter restricts people, the

Is snowboarding like waterboarding, but with snow instead?





    The tone sounds for the floor where the alarm is triggered, the floor 
    above it (smoke goes up), and the floor below it (water goes down). The 
    reason for the protocol is to prevent over-crowding of the stairwells 
    and to evacuate the people that the incident most immediately affects 
    first.

With this system, unless you know what the evacuation tone is, you
cannot be sure whether you have heard it or not.  And lots of people
seem not to know.  Apparently it is not self-evident.


How about splicing the word "evacuate" every three seconds
into the evacuation tone?  That should make it clear that it
IS the evacuation tone.

Meanwhile, on other floors, how about saying
"Your floor has not yet been told to evacuate"
when the evactuation tone would have been?






After reading http://www.mass.gov/Eeops/docs/dps/bbrs_regs/780CMR_Ch09.pdf,
the section about voice warning systems, it does NOT seem to prohibit
an additional announcement such as

  This area has not been told to evacuate.  Please remain alert, and
  get ready to evacuate, in case the order to evactuate this area is
  given later.

It says what the evacuation tone should sound like, but doesn't
seem to prohibit saying the word "evacuate" after it finishes.




    >   This area has not been told to evacuate.  Please remain alert, and
    >   get ready to evacuate, in case the order to evactuate this area is
    >   given later.

    A problem I have with all this (I should admit I work remotely, though)
    is the possibility of the system failing after it's told some people
    not to evacuate.

That flaw exists in the current system, and my suggestion would make
it no worse.




You sent an attachment in Microsoft Word format, a secret proprietary
format.

Distributing documents in Word format is bad for you and for others.
You can't be sure what they will look like if someone views them
with a different version of Word; they may not work at all.

Receiving Word documents is bad for you because they can carry
viruses (see http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/acro.html).
Sending Word documents is bad for you, because a Word document
normally includes hidden information about the author, enabling those
in the know to pry into the author's activities (maybe yours).  Text
that you think you deleted may still be embarrassingly present.  See
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3154479.stm for more info.

But above all, sending people Word documents puts pressure on them to
use Microsoft software and helps to deny them any other choice.  In
effect, you become a buttress of the Microsoft monopoly.  This
pressure is a major obstacle to the broader adoption of free software.
Would you please reconsider the use of Word format for communication
with other people?

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html for more
about this issue.




    > But above all, sending people Word documents puts pressure on them to
    > use Microsoft software and helps to deny them any other choice.

    Even worse, it might lead a few people to miss the joke completely.

If there was a joke, it must have been hidden inside the Word file
where I could not see it.




I do have the strings program.  However, finding ways to examine the
text inside Word files when we get them doesn't sufficiently address
the problem that Word files cause.  We need to push back against the
practice of using Word format for communication.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html for more info.

Microsoft has designed the next version of Word format so that it can
use patents to forbid free software from supporting that format.  (See
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/microsoft-new-monopoly.html.)




    GSB is for relaxation, and the GSB announcements are to make us laugh.

This list is not for GSB alone.  Occasionally important issues, such
as fire safety or the campaign against using Word files for
information interchange, will be mentioned.




      People didn't take it seriously for years, but now
    everyone does.  Sure, there are more battles to be fought, but you've
    won.  So why do you keep acting like a loser?

I act like someone who is aware how far we have to go before freedom
has actually won.





    For that, I apologise to Richard.  I meant no
    disrespect, and the main, positive part of my message was sincere.

I forgive you, and I appreciate your support for the cause.




You sent the attachment in Microsoft Word format, a secret proprietary

The practice of sending other people documents in Word format has bad
effects, such as spreading viruses.  It also puts pressure on everyone
to use Microsoft software.  In effect, you become a buttress of the
Microsoft monopoly.  Would you please avoid using Word format for
communication with others?

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html for more

Would you please send announcements in free formats?  HTML and PDF are
ok, but plain ASCII text is definitely best for announcements.




    Is there a shredder in Stata that can be used by folks in CSAIL? If so,

    The firefox plugin, called FindAlong, 

Is this free software?  If not, would you like to release it as
free software?

    We would love to hear your feedback about findAlong. We are planning  
    to remake this into a web-based service (instead of a plugin),

Please don't do that.  The way you have already done it is good for
freedom; what you're planning to do is not.

As a plug-in, if it is free software, users can use it while
maintaining control over their own computing.  Assuming users find it
useful, it will be a positive contribution.

But if you convert it into Software as a Service, then its users would
inevitably lose control of their computing.  That would convert
something positive into something negative.




      Cloud computing is happening, it is the future, and the free 
    software movement should embrace it and not try to dissuade people from 
    using it.

Are you saying we should surrender to every trend and never resist?
Or is it, "Surrender, resistance is useless?"  I think we should
choose our future.

People told me the same thing about proprietary software in 1983 (and
some have continued saying it ever since).  We resisted anyway, and
it's a good thing we did.

You've used the term "cloud computing", but I did not say that.  That
term is too nebulous to refer to anything in particular.  If it has
any meaning, it can only be, "Don't pay attention to who controls your
data or your computing.  Just trust every company."

I think it's foolish to trust every company, but the issue I've raised
is about a more specific kind of scenario: Software as a Service.  We
can avoid it, and avoiding it is the only way to maintain our freedom.

      For Umar's case, there are benefits to be had by using a 
    Software as a Service model, mainly zero install overhead, instant 
    platform independence, the software can have instant bug/security fixes, 
    and the service can provide the computation to the end user if heavy 
    lifting is needed thereby allowing the software to be used by people 
    with old computers.

These benefits are conveniences.  Should we give up our freedom for
minor conveniences like this?  I hope not.





    Software as a service, if the software underlying the service is
    released as free software, and the service provides a transparent
    way for users to get *all* of their data out of it, is a lovely
    model that I would think you would embrace.

I hope all the software running on the server is free software
because, if not, the server's operator does not control the computing
it does.  I hope he avoids ceding control to others through
proprietary software.  But even if he avoids that, it does not mean
you as a client control the computing that server does for you.

If all the software as released as free software, that does make a
difference.  Namely, it enables you to set up the software on your
own computer so as to do the computing under your own control.

If a server does not let you get all your data out, that is an abuse,
whether that server's activity is SaaS or not.  But there are other
bad things someone can do with your data: alter it, delete it, or hand
it over to someone else.

Some proprietary programs have spyware features, condemned because
they send the user's personal information to someone else.  SaaS is
effectively equivalent to a thoroughgoing spyware feature that reports
all your inputs.

The reason we need to use free software and reject proprietary
software is for our freedom, including the freedom to control our own
computing.  For the same reason, we need to reject SaaS.

      It the same logging into a communal server and running emacs  
    there instead of running emacs locally.

Back when we used a common shared machine, we did so as the members of
a single organization.  The computer belonged to that organization,
not to some company otherwise unrelated to us.  That makes a big
difference.

I'm glad your code is free, but it's not clear about the teaching
materials.  Two of the Creative Commons licenses are free (and open
source, though I think that is less important), but the rest are not
free (nor open source).  The free ones are CC-BY and CC-BY-SA.

In software, nearly all programs that are open source are in fact free
software also.  If you ignore the differences in philosophy and
values, you will find that "free" and "open" are 99% equivalent
at the practical level.

It's totally different in education: lots of "open educational
resources" are not free.  For instance, MIT Open Courseware uses a
nonfree license; all its teaching material is nonfree.  (See
stallman.org/articles/online-education.html.)  In education, it makes
a big practical difference, as well as a difference of ideas, which
word you say.

It is much faster to ask someone a question.

Moreover, in this case, asking creates the opportunity for a
discussion which will be educational regardless of what the answer is.

St IGNUcius will be glad to do that, if the teaching material as well
as the software is free.  But, to avoid misrepresenting him, you had
better avoid the words "open" and "closed" on the page where his
photos are posted, and say "free" and "libre" instead.  "Open source"
is a heresy of the Church of Emacs, and it would be misleading to give
people the idea the saint supports it.

"Throw-away lines" have a deep influence: they spread an idea of
what is generally accepted.  If we don't want a society of pervasive
surveillance, we first need to reject the idea that "Everyone
considers surveillance normal."

The person's research may be interesting, but rejecting that
presupposition is really important.

In my initial message I said

  Would someone like to go to that event and point out that...

I didn't suggest any specific way to raise the point, only
the point to raise.

There are three things that companies may do to employees that blow
the whistle: fire them, blacklist them, and sue or prosecute them.

There are already laws in the US saying companies can't fire people
for certain reasons, but they tend to make up false reasons.
Sometimes courts refuse to believe the false reasons were real.

Stronger than extending FOIA to companies, the government can require
them to disclose certain sorts of things, when there is a public
interest reason.  The US does not do this enough because it is ruled
by plutocracy: the government is more concerned about what businesses
want than what citizens want.  A study specifically showed that almost
all US policy decisions, for 2 decades or more, were decided almost
entirely by elites and special interests.

We have an opportunity to change this now: campaign for Bernie Sanders.

Pieri said:

  > I believe this would be unconstitutional. A public corporation is a
  > legal person which means it has legal rights and obligations.

That doesn't prevent the government from requiring disclosure
of activities that pose a threat to the public.

When the seminar starts with "throw-away lines" that make presuppositions
about issues that are important to society, it is appropriate to
go with an agenda to criticize them.

This does not stop you from learning about the specialized topic of
the seminar itself -- if you are interested in it.  However, because
it is specialized, I would expect that only a fraction of the people
in CSAIL are interested in it.

If you are one of those people, by all means pay attention to the
material of the seminar.  For the rest of us, it is good to rebut the
assumptions about vital social issues included in the "throw-away
lines".

We have read his opinion on this point.  He stated it in the abstract,

This point was not the topic of the seminar, merely a "throw-away
line".  Speakers generally do not to to prove those.  Rather, we're
supposed to presume they are true.

If the car is yours, then it shouldn't tell the manufacturer where you
drive.

If it is a taxi, transporting a passenger, it should not tell the taxi
company who goes where.  If it says where it is, it should not say
who the passenger is.

These two questions are similar in form.  That doesn't imply that the
right answers to both are similar.

But in this case, I think they are similar.  It is wrong to make
people identify themselves to ride in a plane, just as it is wrong to
make people identify themselves to ride in a bus, or a train, or a
taxi.

Indeed, that is true.  That's why I've corrected my point to say that
it that these taxis must not require passengers to identify
themselves.

What I initially said is right for private self-driving cars: they
should not report on where their owners go in them.

In the 1970s, someone at the entrance to Harvard Square Station asked
me for a quarter so he could take the subway.  (That's what the fare
was.)  I gave him one, and instead of walking down the stairs with me,
he said the same thing to the next person who entered.

Since then, I never give cash, but I offer to pay someone's fare,
buy the person food, etc.

Here are some advantages of landlines.

1. A landline phone does not tell anyone where you are, except when
you are talking on the phone.  And even then they may not be able to
tell that it's you rather than someone else.

2. They can't make your landline phone listen to your conversation,
other than your phone calls, except by invading your home.

3. A landline phone keeps working when the electric power is out.

Thanks for inviting people to try GnuCash.

I'd like to point out that GnuCash is free software, developed
as part of the GNU Project for the sake of your freedom.
Calling it "open source" is not factually erroneous, but it gives the
wrong idea of the reasons for developing GnuCash.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.  See also http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler for

Aside from the fact that my office has no windows, it would be silly

because there are other listening techniques.

Skype is particularly bad among proprietary software because one
doesn't use it alone.  Using Skype is not just ceding your own
freedom; it also leads/pressures others to cede their freedom.

    Was wondering why search engines aren't open source yet.

The use of the term "open source" means I have to start by explaining
that I was never in favor of open source software.  I don't aim to
make software "open source", I aim to make it free as in freedom.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.

This concept of "free" applies to programs.  Likewise, "open source"
(which is an offshoot of "free" in this sense) applies to programs.
A program can be free or not.

However, a search engine is not a program.  It is a service -- a
totally different kind of thing, for which different questions arise.

There was a talk Monday at 4pm, and "A cross-VM side-channel attack

VM" sounds interesting.  If someone who attended the talk would like

It's unfortunate that the talk title and description use the term

The abstract of a talk on Nov 13 says:

    Gathering user context such as user activity, geographic
    location, and location type requires continuous sampling of these sensors.

I feel like going there and saying, "What you are trying to do is
wrong.  It shouldn't be done at all.  If you would like to know
something about a user, ask him directly -- and accept 'None of your
business' as a valid answer."

I can't do this because I will be out of town.  But I hope that some
of you share this feeling and would like to go there and present it
forcefully.

The speaker works for Microsoft, and has surely found an excuse to
consider this work a good thing.  Criticism is not likely to change
his mind.  But we have a good chance of leading others to think about
the issue more, and that would be a good achievement.

       I feel like going there and saying, "What you are trying to do is
       wrong.  It shouldn't be done at all.  If you would like to know
       something about a user, ask him directly -- and accept 'None of your

    Isn't the issue not that the device samples its sensors, but rather
    that the device then proceeds to transmit the information to Apple or
    Google or Big Brother or whomever?

That's right.  And that's what this is all about.

    No, it isn't.  For example, phones can determine their location by only 
    listening (to GPS signals), without anyone else learning their 
    location.  There are many types of sensors that only the phone knows it 
    is measuring, and therefore can respect privacy.

That is possible for some kinds of data, but I think Microsoft will
choose to collect personal data even when that is not strictly
necessary.  A company that has already implemented spyware
does not deserve the benefit of the doubt.

I agree with your interpretation of the goal.  I understood it the
same way you do, all along.

    [A phone] gathering user context such as user activity, geographic
      location, and location type requires [the phone's] continuous
      sampling of these sensors

This goal seems to imply a plan to send some data to a server:

If "location type" means "Is this a restaurant or a drug store or a
toy store," how would the phone determine that?  I think it will send
the GPS location to Microsoft servers to get a response about what
sort of place it is in.

However, if you think this may not be so, how about raising that
question at the talk?

Since we don't know what Microsoft might do, and since it could change
policies secretly anyway, I think it is also useful to think about the
worst case.  If Microsoft collects all the information that the phone
gathers, what would that imply?

Since the book fair will be full of people who love books,
it would be useful to go there and hand out printed copies
of http://stallman.org/ebooks.pdf, so as to warn them about how
commercial ebooks threaten the future of activities like this one.

This would not be a protest against the book fair -- rather, an

Take a stand for privacy during City Council's vote

Join us in Cambridge: http://click.actions.aclu.org/?qs=5fd4272876abeb56fad59ecdf568c8d8997f0bab046a8e0ed3826dc5eb791899

Say no to more surveillance in Cambridge!

Monday, Oct. 7 at 5:30pm
Cambridge City Hall
795 Massachusetts Ave.

Questions? Email privacy at aclum.org

RSVP FOR SURVEILLANCE ORDER: 
http://click.actions.aclu.org/?qs=5fd4272876abeb56fad59ecdf568c8d8997f0bab046a8e0ed3826dc5eb791899 

Dear ACLU supporter,

 Last Thursday, concerned Cambridge residents packed a City Council hearing to testify against use of Homeland Security surveillance cameras.
 
 Those efforts have led to an official proposed action in the Cambridge City Council that will bring transparency and more community discussion on the issue of surveillance cameras and data collection and retention policies.
 
 On Monday, October 7th at 5:30pm, the Cambridge City Council will vote on an order prepared by Councilwoman Marjorie Decker. We need you there in support!

Cambridge Surveillance Order Meeting 
Monday, October 7 at 5:30pm
Cambridge City Hall
795 Massachusetts Avenue

The proposed order would require an "affirmative vote by the majority of the city council" before any surveillance cameras or other devices are turned on in Cambridge, or before any policy pertaining to cameras is implemented by the city.

This order is an important first step to ensure that any policy the City of Cambridge decides to enact concerning surveillance cameras, data collection, data sharing and retention is vetted for effectiveness, as well as the protection of privacy and civil liberties of Cantabrigians.

Please also make your voice heard before this important vote on Monday. We hope to see you there, but especially if you cannot make the hearing, please contact the Cambridge City Council at 
council at cambridgema.gov and ask them to support Councilor Decker's order pertaining to surveillance cameras.

Help keep Cambridge safe and free!

    A colleague started a company (http://cens.io/) that uses cell
    phone sensor information (compass, GPS, accelerometer, etc.) to
    try to figure out how (un)safe a driver is.

I wonder how they plan to convince drivers to use this.
Will people that don't have cell phones have to pay extra

    We've been doing dorm lists so far, and we thought it might be fun to mix
    it up a bit this week. So, members of CSAIL and Media Lab, add literally
    whatever you want!

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jwXDOjzLqbmCYStUBH73inq9lrCAoaBIIf7mo22JXHo/edit?usp=sharing

I would have liked to see it, but docs.google.com
requires the use of nonfree software (in Javascript)
just to _look at_ the contents.

Because of this, it's a very bad thing to suggest that people use
Google Docs.  It has the effect of pushing them to run nonfree
software.

Since you do this regularly, how about setting up
a wiki to do it with, on your own site?
I can probably find someone at MIT to set it up for you.

    Usually the official statement is that drivers that allow the insurance
    company to track them will pay less. E.g.:
    http://crave.cnet.co.uk/cartech/gps-telematics-boxes-provide-cheaper-insurance-for-young-drivers-50002428/

This is absolutely disgusting -- it uses financial pressure to make
people get accustomed to being tracked everywhere they go.

    Is anything wrong with Firefox OS from your perspective?

1. It is not a complete OS: it requires nonfree driver libraries.
In this regard, it is like Android (in the best cases), Ubuntu, etc.

2. It pushes people towards entrusting their data to servers
(very foolish) and to depending on SaaSS (an abuse).  See
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html.

The closest thing to a free software cell phone
is to install Replicant (replicant.us), the free version of Android.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html
for Android's freedom flaws.

I thought I knew what's bad in Ubuntu, but maybe I don't:

      We are not telling Amazon what you are searching for. Your anonymity
      is preserved because we handle the query on your behalf. Don't trust us?
      Erm, we have root.

Is that really true?  Does Canonical have root access to every Ubuntu
installation???

Meanwhile, Amazon DOES get some info from this.  When it sends ads
to the machine, it knows what IP address it is sending them to.
And it knows which ads.

    To be fair to Shuttleworth: what he clearly meant here is that every
    Ubuntu installation runs binaries which are under Canonical's control
    at high privilege levels.

"We have root" is a very specific claim, and very different from "we
made binaries you run".  If this is the fact he was referring to, he
chose an exaggerated way of stating it.

      Users are trusting them not to corrupt their
    distributed binaries with malware, or otherwise distribute binaries
    which are built from something other than the distributed source code.

That is true, but not persuasive.  It's comparable to arguing, "Every
day you pass me on the street and you trust me not to pull out a knife
and stab you, so you should lend me $5000 and trust me to pay you
back."

    The same is true of every other mainstream linux distribution

There are no Linux distributions; Linux by itself won't run.
These are GNU/Linux distributions.

See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html and
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html.

    I agree fully with Richard's concerns about "cloud" storage of apps and 
    data.  Both are showstopper issues for me, but there might be practical 
    ways around that with Firefox OS.

I would suppose there are ways around it; if you try hard enough, you could
do somethings locally.  But it may not have enough local memory for you to
do very much that way.

    According to Canonical they are acting as a middle-man (or I assume that's
    what they mean when they say they handle the request on your behalf),

Their statement is general.

									  so
    only Canonical would have access to your IP and search query, and then
    Amazon would only have the query Canonical sends over.

Their statement does not really say anything about this question.
What I've heard (though I don't recall where) is that the ads are sent
to the user's machine from Amazon.

If someone would like to check the facts, then we could know for
certain.

    Does anybody know how to fix the printer? I upgraded and after that I can't
    print. :(

Around 34 years ago I too had problems with a Xerox printer due to
secret software I could not change.  It led me to conclude that
proprietary software is an injustice and we should not stand for it.

Since MIT has wound up in the same problem again, I hope more people
will draw that lesson.  Get rid of your iThings!

    It may be worth noting that this appears to be a CUPS driver
    issue, and that CUPS is in fact not a proprietary "iThing."

I don't think it changes much.

The problem is about interaction with nonfree software.
34 years ago, it was nonfree software in a printer.
Now it's nonfree software in some people's computers, interacting
with a printer.

Ethically, the lesson is the same: proprietary software is an
injustice, and we should not stand for it.

    There have been multiple instances recently of an intruder using 
    computers in open areas within the Stata Center after hours.

Since he just wants to use computers, why treat him as a monster or a
threat?  That spreads paranoia.  Instead of calling him an "intruder",
CSAIL could give him an account.

We used to call these people "tourists", and invite them to join in
our software projects.  Professor Szolovitz started out as a tourist.

Apparently you not only have to tell _them_ that you're interested,
but tell Google as well.

To ask people to register for anything through a data banking company
such as Google or Eventbrite is a contribution to massive surveillance.

Massive surveillance is a threat to democracy
(see http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html),
so I don't think we should go along with it merely because it is

used in service of a "good initiative".  It is not merely annoying, it
is harmful.  The people behind an initiative are responsible for how
it's done, so they should do it the ethical way.

That's even more true given how easy it is to avoid the massive
surveillance, with well-known methods that have been used for decades
or centuries and do less surveillance.  For instance, hold an event
and invite people to come, and invite people to send email or phone if
they are interested.  The latter methods are not impervious to all
surveillance, but they are less susceptible and allow people to resist.

A simple solution: don't associate registration with selling lunch.
It may not be absolutely ideal.  But when freedom is at stake, we must
value it over minor practical advantages.

There is another way you can offer lunch.
You could bring a reasonable number of lunches, and sell them
to whoever will buy them.

You could bring a reasonable number of lunches and sell them,
and if the demand seems higher than you expected, you could get
from some nearby restaurant and sell those too.

If only defending freedom were always so easy!

For clarity's sake, it is important to avoid saying
"IP" when the topic is really "copyright".  The term "intellectual

different laws, and that is confusing.

In general, a person who talks about "intellectual property"

Please don't send posters in Microsoft Word format.  Doing so bolsters
Microsoft's power.  (They are also painfully large, not something
people like to get in their mailboxes.)

So if someone sends you a Word file and asks you to redistribute it,
please tell him no.

It may be useful to cite
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html
as an explanation of why the format is bad.




    I won't complain -- I realize I'll come off as 
    either snobbish or too cheap to pay a few hundred bucks for MS Office -- 
    but I won't go to any effort to read it.

If you stand for a principle, people who oppose your stand may
sometimes try to smear you, even with absurd distortions.

However, we can clarify the stand to demonstrate the absurdity of the
smears.  For instance, a snob might say, "Microsoft Word is ok for
you, but I am above that."  A freedom campaigner says something
different: "I deserve freedom and you deserve freedom, so neither of
us should use Word."  Someone might be considered "cheap" (though I
think it is misguided to twist "frugal" into a criticism) for saying,
"I can't afford Word", but a freedom campaigner says, "I'd rather
spend money to help ethical (free) software projects replace
proprietary software."

Word format can be inconvenient in practice.  It also supports a
powerful company's campaign against software users' freedom.  Which of
these two reasons to reject it is more powerful?  That depends on what
values are important.  Is convenience more important than freedom?

Since the time I decided to campaign against using Word file for
communication, I've occasionally received Word files that held
information I wanted to know.  If I were concerned only with what was
convenient for me at the moment, I could have found some way to read
them.  But there is more at stake here than reading a file.  In the
long term, it is better to end the practice of sending Word files than
to cope with it.  And we can end the practice.  All we need to do
is refuse, on principle, to read Word files.







Please don't be so quick to negate the effect one person can have by
firmly and calmly objecting to Word attachments.  I have convinced
many individuals, and a number of institutions, to stop.  Most of them
were not impressed by my name, so anyone else could have convinced
them the same way.

I'm glad you consider my work successful, but I have to point out that
my work is for free software (free as in freedom) -- not open source.
I disagree with the basic values of the open source philosophy.
See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of how free software is different.





    Windows costs me considerable time when I meddle with it, and would
    cost me money if I were a more upstanding member of society.

As a fully upstanding member of society, you would stick to free
software running on GNU/Linux or some other free operating system.

However, supposing that you're going to use Windows, it is better if
you don't add the secondary wrong of paying Microsoft.




    Yes, I spoke with Meg. She sent the flyer to Karen Shirer with a request 
    that Karen print out a few and post them; Meg didn't ask that it be 
    forwarded anywhere.  She is aware of the issues of forwarding Word docs, 
    and sent this one to a colleague she knew used Word.

Surely Meg didn't go to the effort of making a poster solely for a few
to be printed out at CSAIL.  It must have been intended to be used
elsewhere, too.  That would call for making a PDF -- and once that's
going to be made, it is better to send only that format and no other.

(Sending it via a web page rather than an attachment is also a good
idea, as others have said.)




    Join in this
    hands-on workshop to create a prototype real-time Peace-Builder Toolkit for
    Congressional Districts using cloud computing (Salesforce.com), GovTrack, and
    Google maps.

The project goal is very good, but using Salesforce means you
won't control the computing that you do, and that's not good.

I think there are free software packages for recording your
relationships with people; if an organization uses them, on its own
server, it will have control of its own computing.

(The term "cloud computing" is designed to lead attention away
from the question of who controls your computing, so it is
better to avoid it in favor of more specific terms.  See
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#CloudComputing.)




    Nobody should ever be using IE as Marek pointed out.  Get Google
    Chrome (Free software)

Google has three different products with confusingly similar names:

* Chrome is a non-free browser released only as binaries.

* Chromium is a browser released in source code under a free software
  license.  I think it has a few problems about being a good part
  of the free world, and people are making efforts to fix them
  with a modified version.

There is no way to know what software differences there are
between Chrome and Chromium.  Chrome, as non-free software,
cannot be considered safe.

* Chrome OS is a GNU/Linux distro designed so that the user cannot
  install programs on the machine at all.  Thus, it pushes users
  towards Software as a Service.  ISTR hearing of other problems in
  the specifics, but I don't recall the details.





You made yourself vulnerable to this by using proprietary software
from Microsoft and Adobe.  Much of that software is technically very
vulnerable, but even worse is that it takes away the users' freedom
even when you don't encounter a bug.




Will you release the program as free software?
(See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.)
If you ask people to contribute to your work,
that is a further reason to contribute your work to society.

I've designed a simple way to make the third floor vision demo see
only people who come close to it.  With this, the demo will be easy
for people to try, and will respect the privacy of those that don't
come near.

It involves making a sheet of opaque material (paper?) with a hole in it,
and moving the camera.

I've got approval for installing this.  All that's needed is someone
to build the sheet of opaque material.  It might take 20 minutes of
work.  I'm volunteering 10 hours a day already; would someone like to
volunteer to build this?

I guess so.  Still I don't see why that would have motivated anyone to
remove it.  If someone objected to it, I would like to know what the
objection was.

I don't actually know that someone intentionally took it down.  That

This particular demo does not need to record data, or to have a
network connection, but surely some other future demos will need one
or the other.  Let's establish a practice that is good for future
demos as well.

  > let that camera see what it needs to see for its research purpose
  > ?

It's a demo, not an experiment.  Thus, I don't think it has any
"research purpose".

But if it did have a research purpose, that would be all the more
reason to give people the choice not to be experimental subjects.

I would like to suggest, briefly, that those who appreciate software
freedom change the Subject line in this discussion, replacing "open
source" with "libre".  When you say "libre", you stand for the
principle that users should have control of their computing.  When you
say "open source" you support those who say it doesn't matter much.

The projects could be the same no matter what you call them -- but
standing visibly for freedom is vitally important, totally aside from
those projects.  What's more, the projects MAY not be the same.  If
the people doing those projects think of them as "open source", they
are likely not to focus their attention on freedom for their users.
For instance, they might incorporate a nonfree module or make the code
depend on a nonfree library, which would make their project useless
for users that want to keep their freedom.

for more explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.  See also http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler for

I would do a little extra work to save you that minor inconvenience.
However, to make my Subject field promote "open source" would not be a
matter of extra work.  Rather, it would mean altering what I say to
the list as a whole.

Your point about business is valid in many cases.  However, I'd like
to correct one common misunderstanding that appears in the message.

  > (This applies to Free Software as well as the broader category of
  > OSS.)

It is commonly believed that numerous projects are open source but not
free.  In fact, such projects are quite rare.  The practical criteria
for free software and open source are written quite differently, but
the open source criteria were designed to be close to equivalent to
the free software criteria, and they come pretty close.

I know of only one program whose source code is open source but not
free: OpenWatcom.  It carries an unusual, restrictive license
which is too restrictive to qualify as free software.

If you think you know of another such exception, please tell me
about it.  We can check whether it really is one.

The chief difference between free software and open source is at the
level of values.  What is important?  What are we trying to achieve?
One can describe the same project either way, and the choice of terms
changes what one says.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.  See also http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler for

You may already know this, but it needs to be stated from time to
time.  There is something much worse about Adobe Acrobat than the
possible nonavailability of one feature.

Adobe software is non-libre, which means it is distributed so as to
subjugate whoever uses it.  Its price is freedom as well as money.
See http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html.

Non-libre software is often malware.  Adobe software is malware in
some ways; for instance, it depends on a subscription.

MacOS is also proprietary software, and it is also malware
(see http://gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html for details).

I can't tell you what to do, and I am not going to nag you to stop,
but a discussion of user-subjugating software shouldn't completely
ignore the wrong that it does.

I would expect that most of the people who run those projects on

let alone thought seriously about the issues raised therein.

It is habitual in the software field to judge questions by practical
convenience, then practical convenience, then practical convenience.
If they did view that page, and see the issues we raise, they would
not necessarily consider them important.  When people are in the habit
of judging by practical convenience, persuading them to be concerned

have a chance of convincing them.

You could increase the chance by writing to them and suggesting that they

A job interview is an opportunity for the job-seeker to learn about
the company as well as vice versa.  The surprise demand for an NDA
tells you two things about the management: they are secretive and they
are manipulative.  Do you really want to work for a company like that?

I've had companies spring an NDA at me at the door as I was arriving
for an invited visit.  Since I consider an NDA for generally useful
technical information to be immoral, and I refuse without exception, I
told them "no way".  They came up with an alternative.

Google asked me to sign an NDA when I went there the first time to
speak to the staff.  I refused, and ISTR they decided I didn't have to
sign.  Later I discovered that they had set aside an area for staff to
meet visitors with no NDA.

If "IP" is short for "intellectual property", the statement is too
vague and confused to make any sense.  It describes a fear of
something that is mostly impossible.  I don't think they could
possibly appropriate someone else's copyright or patent through
something a candidate might say in an interview.

I can't help with your technical problem -- I don't know those
programs.  But since you're having a hackathon, I suggest reading
gnu.org/philosophy/hackathons.html, and then (if you think it is a
good point) bringing it to the attention of the participants.

There are two possible moral reactions to such a situation:

* If it's going to be done, I may as well get the benefit of
  participating.

* If it's going to be done, I can at least avoid the shame
  of participating.

If your conscience is strong and awakened, it will say the second one
is right.  If you are not in a desperate situation, why settle for
less?

And, who knows, if you don't do it, maybe no one else will.

I think that application is laudible -- but since the subject would
presumably consent to be monitored, there are are lots of ways to do
it which are easier because they depend on the subject's cooperation.
For instance, by wearing a necklace or bracelet.

Depending on the subject's cooperation would remove the danger of
bad uses; only the good uses would be enabled.

So why develop instead a technology that works without the cooperation
of the subjects, and even on people who are unaware of being tracked?

GCC is so dissimilar to the case at hand that it sheds no light on
that case.  Contrasting it with GCC teaches us that GCC is too
different for that contrast to teach us much.

GCC is a single tool which is general purpose.  You can't judge a
general purpose tool by what it may be used to do, because it may be
used to do anything and everything.  Ultimately the only question is
whether you are in favor of general purpose tools.  I am in favor of
them.

However, the technology we are discussing here is not general.  It is
tecnology to track people's movements.  That is a very specific kind
of job.  Thus, we can judge this new technology by whether this
specific kind of job is good.

You've presented a number of difficulties in monitoring old people
that have mental problems.  But you haven't proved the claim that a
system like this is the only one that can possibly work for them.
That would require a careful and exhaustive investigation.

My mother was as frail as can be, and she wore a monitor.  Perhaps you
are thinking of a minority of old people.

Old people are not the only people whose interests are at stake here.
All of us are affected by advances in surveillance.

  > >>GCC is a single tool ...used to do anything and everything.

  > GCC can't do anything and everything.

That is correct, but you misunderstood what I wrote.
Perhaps that was my fault.

GCC does one thing: compile programs.

I said that GCC may be used to do anything and everything.  Meaning
that a broad range of projects, which might do anything and
everything with various programs, can use GCC to compile them.

This responds to someone else who proposed judging GCC based on what
sort of programs are compiled with it.  We can't judge a compiler that
way.

  > >> It is a technology to track people's movements.

  > It can be used to do anything and everything.

Aren't we talking about a technology that is designed specifically to
detect the position and movements of human bodies in a space?

Because it is for specific purposes, we can judge it based on those
specific purposes.

  > The technology may not be as general as GCC but it is as much of a tool

I don't think anyone said it wasn't.  My point is that it is a rather
specific tool, which can be used for a limited set of jobs.  Thus, we
can judge it by what kinds of jobs it can be used for.

I agree that is good.  But that can be done without furthering
surveillance.

That the people who use this, will do so knowingly and willingly.
They will cooperate with tracking.

The problem with this particular technology is that it tracks everyone
that is in range of the sensors.

I urge we develop technologies that do track the movements of people
who cooperate with the tracking, and do not track the movements of
those who do not cooperate.

  > You are confusing surveillance with motion tracking.

You must have misunderstood me.

Surveillance is collecting personal data about people.
Tracking as such is not surveillance, but it lends itself
towards being used for surveillance.

I think you are overlooking some of the facts.

You can see a webcam; you can't tell that the radio tracking is
present.  You can block a camera's vision with anything opaque; You
can't block the radio tracking very easily.

That is true, and this might be totally useless for surveillance on a
busy street.  However, if it were operating inside your apartment
unknown to you, it could be very effective.  It could distinguish
you from your flatmates by behavior.

All of this may be true but I don't think it proves anything about the
issue at hand.  Each method for observing people in their homes would
have its own advantages and disadvantages; just because some already
exist, it doesn't follow that a new method doesn't make things worse.

  > you are trying to fight projects 

I am not trying to fight this project.  I don't know whether it is
harmful.  I see the possibility.  That's why I started the discussion
by saying this:

    Is this one of the projects it would be better not to do?

I don't think that this question has an automatic blanket answer.  You
may be right that the surveillance potential of this technology is
zero -- though just listing other surveillance technologies doesn't
demonstrate that conclusion.

Several responses presented blanket conclusions, saying that we don't
need to consider this question ever.  For instance, "If a technology
has a good use then it is good," and "it's impossible to judge a
specific technology at all because anything is possible."  If I am
fighting something it is the idea that we don't need to study the
question for technologies with an obvious specific potential for harm.

Yes, that is the contrast I am making.

It is not useful try to judge GCC by what sort of programs are compiled
with it, because all sorts of programs are compiled with it.

But it makes perfect sense to judge a sensing technology
that is developed for sensing how people move around in an apartment,
because you'd have to strain to find another real use.

To be sure, we can imagine conceivable uses.  In theory, this could be
used to track the movements of animals in a barn or a coop.  But just
because they are conceivable doesn't mean they are significant.

Your project seems to be a good one, but I think it follows a pattern
of concentrating on the lesser of two related issues about personal
data, and ignoring the greater issue.

The lesser issue is rules for _using_ collected personal data.
The greater issue is rules for what data may be collected.

Once a database is collected, it is sure to be misused, because
there are several ways that can happen:

1. By the organization that collected the data.
2. By organizations it makes the data available to.
3. By rogue employees.
4. By thieves, having stolen the data.
5. By the state, having taken the data
   using the PAT RIOT Act or some other country's equivalent.

Whatever rules we set for use of the data, channels 2 through 5 are
likely to ignore them.

Thus, the reliable way to prevent that is to prevent collection of the
data.  See https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.

Development of better rules use of the data is worth doing, but let us not
be distracted from pushing to limit surveillance itself.

In hardware, as in software, using the term "open source" is a way of
burying the most important issues -- the issues of freedom and justice
-- under a "pragmatic" (amoral) stance.

For those of you who do care about freedom in computing, I suggest
showing your support by using the terms "free" or "libre" rather than
"open".

See https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-hardware-designs.html
and https://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html.

  > SIPB has done some fairly successful hackathons, and I doubt any of
  > them haven't been open-source.

If the programs are open source, they are almost surely free software.
So the projects are more or less good, at a practical level.

Do they state explicitly in advance that the software must be free
(or even open source)?  Or is that merely how it generally comes out?

Do they make rules about not depending on nonfree programs?  If not,
these programs may be free but trapped (see
http://gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html for a past example).

Every hackathon should state explicit rules about these point, both to
make sure the result is usable in the free world, and to educate people
that freedom is important.

I gave it a try, but when I looked at the terms of service it wanted
me to agree to (www.webex.com/terms-of-service.html), I found that
clause 6 included a proprietary software license.  That's an
injustice, so I did not agree.

The terms also include a prohibition on showing anyone a screen shot.
I would not agree to that either.

Since the discussion is about privacy, it is noteworthy that the site
asks people for their name and email address.

In digital privacy, the biggest picture is that it is wrong to collect
data about people when there is any way to avoid doing so.  See
http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.

To ask for personal information from people watching a stream is
exactly what should not be done.  To do this in an event about privacy
gives the impression that vital lessons are not being learned.

It is easy to do streaming with free software with no "terms of

please switch?  I can put you in touch with people who would be glad
to give you technical guidance for this.

You surely know this app is proprietary software, and so is the
operating system it runs on.  I would reject it for that reason alone,
but I guess you don't.

However, I've read that internet banking is dangerous for another,
independent reason: banks have used it to shift the burden of fraud
from the bank onto the depositor.  For this reason, I shun internet
banking entirely, and would not use it even if I could do it running
only free software.

A few years ago there was a campaign to punish the big banks,
including Bank of America, for their role in causing the financial
crisis, by moving money out of them.  Bank of America also arbitrary
refused to wire money to Wikileaks.

I am sure you know their policies; but it is one thing to state a

I tried that URL before I posted about this.  I tried it in IceCat
with Javascript disabled.  Nothing appeared -- the window was blank.
The page has Javascript code, which is manifestly nonfree.

I don't know why you got different results.

I've actually done it both ways, and my experience leads me to
conclude that moral criticism is absolutely crucial.

However, we're also working on the other approach.  I found a
volunteer to work on a free front end for Dropbox.  However, there is
no telling whether he will finish the job.  And even if he will, I am
sure he could use help.  How about joining in?

You've changed the subject entirely.  The issue I raised is about
what is right to do.  You've "responded" by telling me I have
no right to tell him what to do.  I agree, but that's not the issue.

This is a very common way of ducking an ethical issue: change the
subject from "is it right to do that?" to "who decides?"  There are people
who use this to duck every issue about what is right to do.

I tried IceCat because it's a browser, and I figured that a browser
was the best way to find out what that URL does.  It didn't occur
to me that I would get some different results with wget.

Is it generally true that dropbox gives the payload file directly
when accessed through wget?  In other words, does the recipe
of "use wget" work universally to fetch files posted on Dropbox,
bypassing the JS code?

If so, that would be very good news -- it would mean that fetching
from Dropbox doesn't pose a problem of nonfree software.

You've explained why these issues are important, so well that
I have nothing to add.  I have just a comment abut one side point.

  > I agree.  This is a failure of documentation and discoverability.

This is one of many bad consequences of referring to the GNU operating
system as "Linux".  The GNU Project gives documentation high priority,
and the FSF even hired people to write manuals.  But when the
community started attributing the GNU system to Torvalds, it reduced
our influence just as it increased his.

  > I think a better analogy might be baking a cake that has some dairy in it
  > and bringing it to a big party where there are a few vegans.

This scenario's elements are all such as to minimize the wrong.  The
party is recreation, so it's not great loss for a vegan not to attend.
But a vegan would probably have a fine time.  Your cake is a small
part of the food at the party, and vegans there will probably find
various other things to eat.

Under those circumstances, I'd agree that you're not doing them any harm
by bringing that cake.

It would be different if the vegans live in a dorm, and their dorm's
dining hall introduces so much non-vegan food that they have trouble
finding anything to eat.  At that point, they might very well protest.

There is a structural difference too.  The reason I and others refuse
to run nonfree software, and the reason we consider it wrong, is that
it denies freedom to those who run it.  It is a matter of human
rights.  Secondarily, nonfree software also tends to be malware (see
http://gnu.org/proprietary/).

By contrast, vegans do not say they reject animal products because
those products do wrong to the eater and they want to protect
themselves from being wronged.  Rather, they are concerned about
other issues, perhaps animal rights.

Most people don't support animal rights that far.  (I don't.)  But if
I establish that someone's dispute with me is premised on a rejection
of human rights, I'll consider that a victory in the debate.

You're grasping at several straws.

  > "They" can already associate each card use with identities, from cameras 
  > and RF.  (I'm speaking of technically obvious and public things.)

That's too fuzzy to be really refuted, but it's clear you're stating a
speculation as a fact.  Identifying people from video is not entirely
reliable, can be defeated, and we don't know that they are even trying
to do this.

By contrast, we know that the card system records everywhere each card
is used.

It is true that if you are carrying a mobile tracking and surveillance
device that the phone system and potentially the FBI tracks you
everywhere.  Some of us don't carry one of those.

You mean, like people at CSAIL?

The event is unlikely, and it wouldn't make much difference if it did
happen.  If we're talking about being suspect because you're reported
to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, that can happen anywhere.
It is just as possible at the subway station where you really were, as
at any other subway station where you weren't.

						  or just getting tainted 
  > when the whole pool gets tainted (as criminal suspect, for example).

It's not only unlikely to happen, it is unlikely to make any difference.
"Tainted" is a superstitious idea, not a realistic none.

    At some point, however,

They won't do it, because it is not worth the trouble.

Any desired conclusion could be demonstrated with such flimsly arguments.
We should keep that in mind, because the proponents of more surveillance
constantly cite unlikely dangers that they "protect" us from.

We need to recognize the unlikely dangers, and ignore them.

Let's teach people to switch charlie cards as the first step.  It's an
easier change, so we have a better chance of teaching more people to
do it.  That will raise their awareness of the surveillance issue, and
that may help us build the anti-surveillance movement.

If you think another approach is better, I'd like to see it.  Maybe it
is better.  But if you only want to argue for giving up, I know that
is not a better approach.

CSAIL's new web site has features that require the visitor to run
nonfree software.  For those of us who won't run nonfree software,
several things simply won't work.

It is not too late to fix the problems.  Would someone in CSAIL
please offer to do the work?

In the mean time, to avoid causing difficulty in your own publications
and whatever you wish to say to people, I suggest that you make a web
site elsewhere, one that doesn't need users to run any Javascript code,
and post everything there.  You could then ask the CSAIL staff to
post in your CSAIL web page a redirect to your own site.

That way you can redirect it without having to run any nonfree
Javascript code yourself.

Here's what I noted down on Oct 29.

    I went to People.  I got a list of PIs plus a few other
    faculty.  These are not all the people in CSAIL, but I can't
    see a way to find any others.  "List view" does not do anything.

    I went to Events.  The events are displayed in a garbled way.
    The controls to select events don't seem to entirely work.

    I clicked on the first three seminar series, and each of them came up
    empty except for one event on Nov 17.  Perhaps that only means you
    haven't put all the real data into this site yet.

It could be that something has been fixed since.
Do these things still fail now?

Does the CSAIL web site have a page about me?  I cannot tell; the
Javascript problem blocks me from searching for me.

If it does have one, could you send me the contents?  I would like to
check the information, and, if necessary, ask for corrections to be
made.

I won't be able to log in to fix them, for multiple reasons, one being
that login depends on running nonfree Javascript code.

Trusting Pantheon is a security and privacy risk.  Trusting
addtocalendar.com is another security and privacy risk.  Trusting
s7.addthis.com is yet another security and privacy risk.

These risks are of the same _kind_, but they are not the same risk.
Thus, they are cumulative.  Taking the risk of trusting Pantheon has
evidently enabled Pantheon to lead CSAIL unto taking two or more
additional risks.

What about correcting other kinds of flaws?  With Pantheon do that?

We have defined several alterative ways to mark JS code as free.  See
https://gnu.org/software/librejs/free-your-javascript.html.  If the
software is free, csail.mit.edu should indicate it this way.

Someone mentioned that it depends on s7.addthis.com and
addtocalendar.com.  Does the user have to run JS code from those sites
too?  Is that code free?

I said "the Javascript problem blocks me", and you said I am not
"prevented".  I am not sure whether those refer to the same question.

With IceCat, a graphical browser, search in the People page fails
completely: the interface features for searching don't respond at all.
In that page I see a list of PIs, and I find no way of making it
display anything else.

It didn't occur to me to try using Lynx; I didn't imagine it might
work given that IceCat fails.  That anomaly surprised me, so I
tried to see what would happen with Lynx.  However, it ran into
another bug so I can't test it now.

Are you suggesting that we should refrain from fixing the practical
problem, to spare the feelings of its developers?

Anyway, wasn't it developed mainly by the staff of a company called
Pantheon?  If they chose the unjust design and failed to do the job
well, why should anyone else feel guilty?

That's what everything in technology is like.  My project developed an
operating system, and at the end of it all there are still bugs, and
most the users credit Mr Torvalds for it.

Despite that, it's a success, and the fact that we developed it is a
very good thing.

I too am using IceCat 52.3.0.  I am at a loss to understand this
discrepancy, so I wonder if we are talking about two different kinds
of searching.

When I visited that page in IceCat, I saw a list of tiles, each with
the photo and name of some group leader or PI.  It worked to click on
them.

At the top, I saw a box on the left of "People" that says "Search Options",
and a box on the right which I presume is meant for entering a pattern
to search for.

Both of those boxes were totally nonresponsive for me.
Do those boxes work for you?

When you say searches work for you, are you talking about those boxes?


Just now I tried it again, and the behavior was different from before.
The two non-functional boxes are unchanged, but afterwards I got the
tiles of people whose names start with A.  After those, there is a
"Load More" horizontal strup at the end which advances to tiles for
the next group of names.  By clicking that repeatedly I can advance
through the whole list.

That's better than what was happening a few days ago.
At least I can see all the names now, though quite laboriously.

Did someone just make a change in the site that improved this?

I agree that it is better to avoid insults in a bug report.  However,
the idea of redoing the job to fix its problems is not itself an
insult.  We've been told that the capacity to fix problems in the site

That's true.  However, some of them can start up without nonfree

The Raspberry Pi is one of the latter.

The tiles (name and photo) in the People page do look pretty.  But
they make the page inconvenient, because with that format it would be
a pain to load the whole list at once.  So we have to click on "Load
more" and wait, over and over, just to look through the list.  Or use
the JS-only Search facility.

For practical use, it would be better to have a simple list as a
single page that you could load all at once.  Then you could scroll
through it to find whichever person you seek, or search for the
person's name with your browser's in-page search.

In other words, this aspect of the site was designed putting
prettiness over usability.  Perhaps that applied to other aspects too.

The more usable design would also be simpler to write.  Implementing
it would not take long.  Perhaps other aspects too.

Does this app send any personal data to a server?  Or does it keep the
personal data exclusively on the user's own computer?

The iPhone is the most unethical of the major computing platforms
since it does not allow applications to be released as free software
for users in general to install.  Android is less bad.

Would you please make your app work for Android, and avoid depending
on nonfree libraries such as Google Play Services?  Then you could
release it as free (libre) software, and users of free versions of Android
(such as Replicant; see replicant.us) could use it.

I suspect that the big ISPs impose contracts that prohibit this.

Looking at csail.mit.edu/people with Lynx, a list of "roles" appears,
and they seem to function properly, giving subsets of the search.

Looking at csail.mit.edu/people with IceCat with Javascript disabled,
that list of roles does not appear at all.

It would be useful to fix the latter case to work as well as lynx.

I have some British 10-pound notes that are going to cease to
be accepted by stores in a few months.

Is there anyone who is going to the UK some time soon and could use
these notes, who would like to trade me an equal sum in notes of other
denominations?

Where you will be working next year is not a matter of fate in which
you have no say.  It is substantially under your control.  No one can
force you to work in a place that you don't like, and no one can force
you to accept employment that involves using proprietary software
Windows or Mac OS.

As a graduate of MIT you will probably be sought after.  Negotiating
for employment gives you a lot of clout.  So you could use the
opportunity to insist on being able to use a free system such as
GNU/Linux or BSD, and being allowed to contribute to free software
projects.

In any case, you're worrying to soon.  Changing how a computer is
set up is not that hard -- you can afford not to worry now
about what you will need in July.





The way to fix this problem and many others
is to install GNU/Linux in those machines.

Yes.  These are two different issues: privacy, and the requirement
for nonfree client software (JS code that runs in browsers).
It would be good to fix the latter even if the former does not change.

Some things are not particularly privacy-sensitive, and for those that are,
you may be able to work around that problem by using your own encryption.

The GPL is solely about Libre.  As any free license must,
the GPL allows selling copies.

Free software is defined by four essential freedoms
(see http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).
Freedom 2 includes the freedom to sell copies as well as the freedom
to give away copies.

I am flattered that is common, because it comes from me -- I started
making the distinction between "free as in free speech" and "free as
in free beer" in my speeches in the 1980s.

But I think it is clearer to use an established and generally known
word.  For most people, it requires no explanation.

I just wish English had an established and generally known word that
meant "free as in freedom".

"Liberty" is a noun, and we need an adjective.
The adjectival form is "libre", which works but has to be borrowed
from French or Spanish.

"Independent software" would mean "developed by a company
that isn't big or dominant."

Where the English vocabulary came from is a tanget.

The difficulty with "libre" is that such borrowing has not occurred
as of yet.  We are compelled to do the borrowing now, and that has
its costs.

It's not for me to make my name into a word for people to use.

"Stallmanized" and "Stallman-safe" by their form express subtle
disdain.  I wouldn't ever use those.  So let's imagine something
else, like "Stallman-style".

People still wouldn't know what it meant, unless they heard
an explanation.

Giving them that explanation is what we do.  Just as people
misunderstand "free software" without an explanation, and they
misunderstand "open source" without an explanation, I expect they
would misunderstand "Stallman-style" without an explanation too.

Since we need to explain our term, I'd rather explain a term
that refers to what the movement is all about -- freedom -- than
a term about a secondary thing such as my name

Actually most people in our field are quite mistaken
about what "open source" means.  For explanation, see
http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html.

But let's pretend that they did understand it correctly.
How did it get that way?  Because of lots of people using
their term.  Their views avoid the central ethical issue
so they are less controversial, and more easily accepted.
Businesses with lots of money promote their term.

If we had that sort of help, we would be quite well known.

You have listed several synonyms for free/libre and several terms for
gratis.  I am not sure it is a bad thing that a language has synonyms,
but if it is bad, it is not our fault.

You also mentioned the term "open source", which induces plenty of
confusion, but remember that that was coined and promoted by people
that disagreed with the free software movement.  If it was a mistake,
the mistake was not ours.

Finally you seem to make an exaggerated negative claim
and then change the subject.

The GNU GPL protects the essential freedoms for all the users of a
program.  It does this through copyleft: the requirement that
distribution of copies, with or without changes, must preserve the
freedoms.

The term "MIT license" is ambiguous(*) so I don't use it, but it's
clear you mean a subset of the licenses that I call pushover licenses.
Distributing a program under a pushover license gives the essential
freedoms to the people that get copies from you, but permits them
to turn around and redistribute nonfree versions of your code to others.
Thus, it can happen that most users of your code do not get freedom.

The result is that release under a pushover license is not a way to
give freedom to everyone that uses your code.

Those that would like to use our code in their proprietary systems
have developed specious arguments, such as claiming that the GPL
"restricts" them.  I've written this haiku to illustrate the hypocrisy
of their views:

  Using GPL
  Is encroaching on our rights
  To encroach on yours


By the way, I now see doubts that the reason you suggested we change
our terminology is not that you wanted us to be more successful in
communicating ideas.  I've learned to be skeptical of advice on how to
achieve a goal offered by someone who doesn't aim for that goal.


* When people say "the MIT license" they are talking about two
different licenses, the X11 license and the Expat license.
To avoid ambiguity I don't use the term "MIT license".
These two licenses are both pushover licenses, but there are others.

  > And I think "right to debug" is a slogan conveying a value proposition that
  > is going to make a lot more sense to 99.999% than "free software"

I tend to think the "right to debug" will only appeal to programmers.
Also, it is just a small part of the freedom we stand for.  For a
program to be free, it must give you a lot more than the right to
debug.  You must be free to add features as well as fix bugs,
and to distribute (even commercially) your modified version.

People often feel that demanding to take away some of the power of
businesses is so shocking that they must not demand only a tiny
fraction of what is required.  If we look at things that way, we will
propose solutions that are half-measures.  In effect, we should take
care not to assume that they must deserve most of the power they have,
even if not all.

Many people and companies develop useful free software under the
banner of "open source".  Their support for that camp doesn't mean
what their work isn't a good contribution.

What that banner intentionally does not do is teach people to think of
the issue as a matter of right and wrong, of human rights.

Also, since people's values affect their actions, people motivated by
the ideas of "open source" are more likely to adopt other policies
that are detrimantal for freedom.  For instance, OpenOffice suggests
nonfree add-ons; LibreOffice does not.  This is not coincidence: each
project acts according to its values and its terminology reflects
those values.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of all these points.

This was widely reported, but the actual events did not amount to so

of a cup that the consumer could fill.  It continues to threaten any

Dear Richard,

In our last message to you, we got excited and overstated Keurig's
recent retreat on DRM. On May 6, the world learned that Keurig Green
Mountain's sales fell 23% in the first quarter of 2015?and their
stock price dropped 10% as a result. The company backpedaled on the
DRM-choked Keurig 2.0 once it became clear that people don't want a
coffee maker that only brews Keurig-branded coffee?but we were a
bit hasty in our declaration that the company will remove DRM from its
products. They haven't committed to that...yet. In fact, they're
simply going to allow refillable cups to work in the machine (like
their older models) and are working to get more coffee brands licensed
as part of their DRM-coffee scheme. We need to keep the pressure on
them.

Also in our last message, we provided a link where you could
update your location information in order to receive emails about
anti-DRM actions in your region. [Here's a much better

"Free source" could work for software, but the concept of free applies
to any kind of work that can be copied -- not only software.  Most of
these works don't have source code.

However, if you find the term good to use, I won't object.

It is true that people mostly don't sell copies of free software
_separately_ any more (though we did sell a lot of copies 25 years
ago).  However, it is quite common to sell products that include
copies of free software.

Meanwhile, the FSF still does sell copies of free manuals.

The "bottom line" is that free software includes freedom to sell
copies.  Whether you wish to do so is another question.

They release their code, against our advice, with a license that says
"You can put your own license on this code."  When companies take
advantage of that by including the code in proprietary software, they
don't seem to mind.  When we exercise that permission by including it
in GPL-covered software, they say we're mistreating them.

It makes no sense, except as a plan to boost proprietary software.

Naturally, those whose goal is to subjugate users, when they come
across our license that won't let them use our code for that, call it
dirty names.  Microsoft once called the GPL a "cancer".

They are just calumny, nothing more.  But I won't mourne if Microsoft
gets sick and dies.  It's not a person, just a business, and one that
mistreats people constantly.  (See
http://gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html.)

That's an oversimplification, but it's basically right.  If you
include some of our GPL-covered code in your program, and you choose
to release it to someone, you must do so under the GNU GPL.  Thus, you
can't turn our code into nonfree software.

		  So for all intents and purposes, a GPL license made
  > software harder to use, not easier.

GPL-covered code is harder to use -- in nonfree programs.
That is intentional.  Preventing people from using our code
in nonfree programs is the _purpose_ of copyleft.
See http://gnu.org/copyleft/.

Or, looked at from the positive side, copyleft says that if you
release a modified or extended version of our program, you must
contribute your program to the free world.

Nonfree software is an injustice in itself (see
http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html).
Nowadays it is commonly the basis for spyware, digital restrictions
management, back doors, censorship and sabotage.  Microsoft does all
of those things in Windows (see http://gnu.org/proprietary/).

The only way to make sure your code does not get incorporated
into proprietary software is to release it under a good copyleft
license, and GPL version 3 is the best one.

In a slightly different world, that would work...
but so many products have been described as "liberating"
in their advertisements, meaning only that they enable

immediately think of that.

In other words, it would have a problem similar to that of

IBM made major changes in Apache that it distributes as a proprietary
web browser.  I am pretty sure it didn't contribute that code to Apache.
I have not heard Apache developers complain about this.

We recommend that people send upstream any small to medium changes
that they make in a program that has a weak license, when the upstream
developers want them.  Cooperating with the program's developers is a
good thing.

However, if we make big changes, like what IBM did to Apache, then we
copyleft them so that our code brings freedom to everyone that uses
it.  We will not make a large piece of code available for IBM to put
in a proprietary program.

We haven't "lost the people" at all.  Most people have never heard our

when people hear it, many find it plausible.

  > Companies won?t use and thus won?t contribute to GPL software.

What you say has a kernel of truth.  It is true that many companies
reject GPL-covered software.

However, you have exaggerated "many" into "all", and that makes it
untrue.  There are also many companies that do use GPL-covered
software.  Some even develop it.  To exaggerate rejectin is a recipe
for perceiving every problem as total failure.

Does rejection by many companies mean we have "lost the people"?  Not
at all.  Companies are not people.

The term "BSD-covered software" should be avoided because there are
two different BSD licenses, and the difference is very important.  See
http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html.

Anyway, I think you mean programs under weak licenses in general,
not specifically those two weak licenses.

Turning to the kernel of truth, there are companies that rationally
conclude that GPL-covered programs are not useful for their purpose --
which is, to incorporate other people's code into proprietary
operating systems.

These companies include Apple, and in some cases Google, which have a
lot of influence.  If you would you like to help us overcome that
influence, one way is to release your code under the GPL.

Although their goals are wrong, their reasoning is rational.

However, other companies reject the simple use of GPL-covered
software, because of irrational fear which has no basis.  They have
been misled by FUD about what the GPL requires.

  > When you take code from FreeBSD you don't say "thank you".

Does "say thank you" mean "make a big public announcement of thanks"?
If so, we have never had an occasion where that was called for.  We
have never copied a large part of the FreeBSD system, as Apple did.

If "say thank you" means "appropriately attribute some specific
program", I don't think the GNU Project has ever copied a whole
program from FreeBSD.

Some programs from FreeBSD may be included in various GNU/Linux
distros.  It is the makers of GNU/Linux distros that incorporate
non-GNU packages, so they are the ones who are responsible for
attributing them.  I think they generally have good practices about
this, but check if you wish.  For instance, do you see a package in
Debian GNU/Linux which came from FreeBSD and isn't credited?

If you see such a thing in one of our endorsed free distros (see
gnu.org/distros), please tell me the specifics and I will urge the
distro maintainer to give credit better.

If we incorporate 50 or 500 lines of code from some FreeBSD program
into a GNU package, we ought to attribute it as we do other code in
the package.  Getting that much code from some FreeBSD program won't
happen every year; I don't know if we have actually ever done so, but
I would guess it has happened.

So is your complaint real, or is it imaginary?

We have a GNU package called IceCat which is a modified version of
Firefox.  The name itself gives wry credit to Firefox, the entry in
directory.fsf.org says it is a modified version of Firefox, and
gnu.org/software/icecat says it is a modified version of Firefox.  I
have never looked at its source release, but I presume that says the
same.

Do you think we should do more?

If that means choosing which free software license to use, I agree.
And I have never said anything else.

If that means choosing to make a program nonfree, then it is wrong.
Real freedom does not include "freedom" to subjugate people with
proprietary software.

  > It includes the freedom to choose no special license.

I am not sure what "choose no special license" means, concretely, but
under current copyright law under the Bern convention, every program
is automatically copyrighted, so unless it carries some specific free
software license, it is proprietary.

See http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#NoLicense.

  > Don't

Don't let anyone bully _or pressure_ you into using their license.

Opponents of copyleft are using financial muscle, FUD, and other sorts
of power against the GPL.  Some institutions try to stop people from
releasing under the GPL.  Some companies say, "We will make your
program a failure if you use the GPL -- and we will give you some help
if you don't."  Ideological opponents of the GPL say "The GPL doesn't
give me real freedom (to make your code proprietary and hand it to
others who won't get any freedom)."

I think that is not quite "bullying", but it's the closest thing to
bullying that I have seen in the question of choosing a free software
license.

  > You use it as an opportunity to

"Lacking ethics" is a subtly ambiguous phrase, which is discreditable
to me in one interpretation, and validly applicable to me in another
interpretation.

I do not say that FreeBSD is unethical.  Quite the contrary: it's free
software, distributed in an ethical way.  I have said so many times.

I criticize FreeBSD developers for using a license does not defend
freedom for all users.  I call this license lax, permissive, weak,
even a pushover.  I have never called it bad, wrong, evil, unjust, or
unethical, because it isn't.

I don't even say that it is ALWAYS a bad choice.

http://gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html describes special
cases where we recommend using a lax, pushover license.  However, it
recommends Apache 2.0 for those cases rather than modified BSD.


There are people who argue against copyleft.  Perhaps many FreeBSD
developers hold those views views.  I criticize their ethical
arguments, but really, you should know that arguing with someone
about the right way to help the world does not amount to condemnation
of that person.

This might be a useful contribution -- I don't know what Azure is --
but it is small compared with the rest of what Microsoft does.
Even if Microsoft had done this eagerly, it would not be a reason
to change our overall opinion of Microsoft.

If Microsoft someday does a lot of free software development, it might
eventually be a reason to change our overall opinion.  But I don't see
much hope of that.  These days, with Windows 10, Microsoft is pushing
many sorts of nastiness to the max.

The crucial question for software freedom is, what can we do
with no nonfree software?  The really important contributions are
those that extend that.

Sometimes the free software community does things that proprietary

proprietary software holds, and so far we have not developed
substitutes.

The result is that there are things that computers can do, but users
pay the price of freedom to do them.

Not quite.  Rather, that is where I say their views are mistaken.

I think just making Microsoft release its changes under the GNU GPL is
a good result.  The users now can use that code with the four
essential freedoms.  That's what the GPL is intended to achieve.

I don't know Microsoft management, but I think that is the case.
Microsoft executives used to call the GNU GPL a "cancer".
Now they have experienced GPL requirements, and complied,
and lo and behold! it wasn't as bad as they thought.
So I think they do view the GNU GPL more favorably now.

I don't advocate open source.

I don't think Microsoft supports the free software movement at all,
but some of these programs are useful free software.  (Watch out about
.Net, though; Microsoft has not in fact bound itself not to sue
the users of .Net for patent infringement.)  If so, that is nice,
but it isn't crucial.

The issue was about Linux and the FSF does not work on Linux.
Microsoft had no legal obligation to discuss this with the FSF.  We
could have given advice if asked; perhaps we did.  But we could not
take action.

Microsoft did have a legal obligation to discuss this with the Linux
developers.  They are the ones who had the legal authority to enforce
the GPL on Linux, and thus the responsibility to do so.

I am glad that Novell carried out this responsibility.

I think you've misunderstood the point under discussion.
Someone claimed (see above) that I am making a mistake in
criticizing unjust actions of some companies because
that prevents me from maintaining "healthy relationships" with them.

I respond that that general statement is mistaken.  "Healthy
relationships" with these companies are not the way to reduce their
power or their misdeeds.

There are many examples of this.  For instance, environmental
organizations have found that quietly building healthy relationships
with companies, or regulatory agencies, is ineffective for changing
them -- unless there is a powerful public movement demanding change.

As for the concept of "mandate", I don't need a special "mandate"
to post here.

We have plenty of that already.  What you mean is that you want us to
adopt a nonjudgmental tone.  You find our condemnation a turn-off and
call it derogatory names such as "dogmatic."

What I see is that your main disagreement is with our principles.
While you appreciate some practical results of our work, which is not
Linux by the way (http://gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html), you simply
don't agree with the basic ethical idea of the free software movement.
You're a supporter of open source.  This shows in your terminology as
well as your arguments.

It is no surprise to me, therefore, that you recommend we stop stating
the basic ethical idea.  Naturally you would rather we'd cease to
campaign for something you disagree with.

You say we will get more support if we drop our ethical goals.  Maybe
so, but support _for what_?  It would be support for open source, not
for the free software movement.  Open source is not what we are
working for.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.

The GNU GPL's job is to require those distributing modified versions
to distribute them as free software.  In the case of Microsoft's
changes to Linux, it achieved its purpose.  That's a good job.

The "self-centered" part seems like a non sequitur.  The GPL is a

On the contrary, the FSF normally address GPL violations
in FSF-covered code by talking privately with the violator.

Our main goal in GPL enforcement is to get the violator to comply with
the GNU GPL, typically to release the source code for what it
distributed, so that the users of that version get the source code.

We resolve most of these cases amicably.  Occasionally a public
announcement is agreed on as part of the resolution.  The rest of the
resolved cases, you will never hear about.

There seems to be a lot of false criticism about the FSF circulating.

I have no memory of this discussion, but Emacs already had another way
of accessing POP3, as part of the movemail utility.  I suspect I
judged that it was simpler, for maintenance, to stick with that.

I am sure I did not reject it simply because I personally would not
use it.  I have accepted hundreds of features in Emacs that I did not
expect ever to use personally.

I see that your pop3.el program is now included in Emacs.

Many people have told me explicitly that other things matter to them
more than freedom -- convenience, competition, pressure from families.
I am simply reporting what they say about their own motives.

In some other cases, I can deduce that they don't value freedom
from specific things that they say.

But that is not everyone.  I do not say that everyone who disagrees
with the free software movement does so in this way.

Thus, I think you are misrepresenting what I have said.  You have done

The Emacs developers are volunteers too, and are constantly making
changes in many files.  To insist that they tell the original
contributors is more than I can demand of them.

I don't know what happened with the maintainer name, but it is easy
for people, making changes in a file from time to time, not to realize that it
adds up to a major rewrite of that file.  Nobody is perfect.

I apologize for that.  The Emacs maintainer should have changed this
when you asked.  I was the Emacs maintainer in 1998 and 1999, so if it
was then that you asked, I personally was at fault.

The file currently says

;; Author: Richard L. Pieri <ratinox at peorth.gweep.net>
;; Maintainer: emacs-devel at gnu.org

so it seems that the maintainer name has been updated since.

I am not trying to convince you of anything, but it is an interesting
question.  Or rather, several different interesting questions, since
those other campaigns are quite different from each other.  Some of
them may be more successful than we are while others are not.  Some of
them may have a valid point while others do not.

You haven't tried to think seriously about those questions.  You made
a simplistic unsubstantiated claim.

Is it true that those campaigns are more successful at winning support
than the free software movement?  I don't know; it is hard to measure
how much support we have.  Suppose some are more successful than we --
why might that be?

Several of those other campaigns suggest a simple change: buy a
similar product from a different place and use it in the same way.
Sellers of those alternate products may fund the campaigns.

Avoiding proprietary software mistreatment is not quite so simple.
Most people get an operating system with the computer; to replace it
takes work and knowledge.

Understanding the harm done by proprietary software is not so simple,
either.

Perhaps people are far more scared of food made with pesticides than
about proprietary software.  Proprietary software won't directly kill
you or make you physically sick, as pesticides might.

However, only a small fraction of those who eat that food will
actually get sick (and this fraction depends on which food it is),
whereas the harm done by proprietary software is a certainty.

Turning to the campaign for greenhouse gas limitation, only a small
fraction of people have made substantial personal efforts to reduce
this.  Mostly supporters participate in mass campaigns demanding
change, for good reason.  Participating in a mass campaign is easier
than cutting your own emissions, and the campaign, if successful, can
cut emissions a lot more than its supporters could by themselves.

Another possibility is that some of those campaigns use methods that
convince more people.  How might that be so?

They may be willing to use irrational or dishonest methods that I
would reject.  Or perhaps they are entirely honest, and more capable
and effective than I am.

I would be glad to see others campaign for free software in different
ways and succeed more than I do -- as long as it really is for free
software, not for a weakened and distorted version that misses the
main point.  Maybe I could learn something from them.

As usual, you misrepresent my views.  This time, you've displayed the
distortion for all to recognize.  Readers will see that you are rebuking
me for something I didn't say or do.

  >   Why is the development of easily-understood messaging not
  > worth the FSF's time?

That question combines a false general assumption with a specific
false accusation.

The false general assumption is the idea that this is a matter of
"time", like digging a ditch -- all we would have to do is deign to
spend some time.

It isn't easy to make a message clearer without distorting it.  In
1998 a group of people said they were going to present our ideas in a
clearer way using the term "open source", but it turned out that they
were presenting a fundamentally different idea.

The specific false accusation is the claim that we don't try to find
better and clearer ways to present our views.

We keep looking for better ways to present our ideas.  Occasionally we
see one we can implement.  For instance, the images in my TEDx talk,
http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society,
seem to help get the idea across quite a bit.

You are talking about "the FSF", but the people who work on Emacs are
not FSF staff.  They are volunteers.  They do this work for the GNU
Project.  The FSF is relevant only to enforce the GPL when necessary.

The "maintainer" slot in a file is to tell the Emacs developers who
they can ask for help with work on that particular file.  They ought
to do that, when it is pertinent.  I want the developers to try to
keep packages' developers involved.

But they are volunteers just like you, and sometimes they don't think
of that.

I understand that it is frustrating for you when they don't discuss
the changes with you.  Sometimes people install their own fix, and
later they do talk with you and you're surprised that there are
changes you didn't know about.

We can't demand they be perfect, because they are volunteers and we
are fortunate that they are willing to help.

  > They will modify your work.

Of course the Emacs developers will modify it.  The Emacs developers
need to fix bugs and integrate other features.  We can't mark some
files off limits to change by all except one person.

We can't impose stiff discipline on a group of volunteers.  But we
could do a better job of taking care to cooperate well.

  > They might break something because they don't

That's life, in the software field.  People change code written by
others, and sometimes they break it.  None of us is perfect.

All sorts of mistakes and carelessnesses are possible.  The only way a
volunteer project like Emacs can make progress is if people forgive
each other.

You have finally revealed your real views.  Your diagreement with the
free software movement is not about secondary points such as methods.
You are opposed to our basic goals and ideals.  You are in favor of
proprietary software.

It is no wonder that you keep suggesting we change our methods.  What
bothers you about our current approach is not that it might fail, but
that it succeeds.

Folks, any time a company suggests you will have more "success" if you
let it turn your code proprietary, remember that what they really want
is to use your work to take advantage of others.

I agree with you.  I do not advocate prohibiting proprietary software,
for the same reason I do not advocate prohibiting dangerous drugs.
This is why the free software movement does not propose to pass a law
to ban proprietary software outright.

No one is morally entitled to the right to make proprietary software.
If someday society has changed and wants to ban proprietary software,
I won't campaign against the proposal.  But I am not campaigning for
such a law.

That does not mean we shouldn't take the existing laws, such as
copyright, that proprietary software developers use against us, and
turn those against them.

What that amounts to is, "Since he's so weak I can take advantage of
him, don't you dare help him resist me!"  Those who expect to prosper
by taking advantage of others often espouse that sort of philosophy.

I think that we make society better by setting it up so that people in
general are less likely to be taken advantage of.  The free software
movement is one part of that.

  > In that regard, I've started to consider the Apache 2.0 license to be

Copyleft does that better, for both developers and users.

Note the crucial ambiguity in the words "Preserving rights ... for the
user".  The construction "for the user" means "for users in general";
but here, only SOME users' rights are preserved.  A weak license
allows the middleman to put that code into a proprietary program,
denying said rights to downstream users.

Thus, the weak license doesn't really "preserve rights" for "the user"
in general.  Only copyleft preserves rights for ALL users.

It's the same thing for the "rights... of the developer".  Copyleft
preserves rights for ALL developers...to use the code in modified free
software.

Weak licenses don't preserve that.  You can't get the code of IBM's
proprietary version of Apache and put it into your own free programs.

Developers are not entitled to the "right" to use our code in
proprietary software.  Not legally (copyright says not), and not
ethically (proprietary software is an injustice).  There is no need to
"preserve" a right they are not entitled to.

Copyleft gives all users and all developers the rights that they are
entitled to.  Weak licenses give some of them the power to deny those
rights to the rest.

  > Let's write great code, show each other how good it is, and let the
  > users decide for themselves how they want to run it.

With copyleft, each user can choose how to run it.  A weak license
opens the door to proprietary versions that deny users that choice.

Leaving out the name-calling, what Pieri says is that I think freedom
is more important than code quality.

Yes I do!  I think freedom is far, far more important than code
quality.

Of course, we would ideally like a program that gives us freedom and
convenience.  But what if there isn't one?  What if we have a choice
of an inconvenient free program or a convenient user-subjugating
program?

My choice is the inconvenient free program.

I will not use a proprietary program because it means being
under some developer's power.  (It's probably malware, too.
See http://gnu.org/proprietary/.)

But I will use an unreliable, inconvenient free program.  If the
inconvenience bothers me enough, I am free to debug it and improve it.
Or look for someone else who wants to do it.  Maybe we could do it
together.

Of those two, which offers a route to a free, convenient program?

We are free to start with the unreliable, inconvenient free program
and improve it, if we care to.  But there is no way we can take the
convenient proprietary program and make it free.

We should choose the inconvenient free program, and improve it until
we are satisfied with it.

I have organized hundreds (maybe thousands) of people to work on
hundreds of public service projects, on a shoestring.  I could not
possibly supervise their work, so I don't try.

So I don't accept responsibility for how well they do the work on
these projects.

pop3.el is not an ordinary part of Emacs.  It is part of a subpackage
called Gnus which was and is maintained by a separate team.

We offer no assurance whatsoever, and we say this explicitly.
Nonetheless, thousands of people use GNU Emacs and find it works
pretty well.

Each Emacs release is preceded by several pretests (beta tests).
Serious problems are usually found then and don't get into a release.

Did the pop3.el problem get into a release?
Or was it spotted in a pretest and fixed?

You've misrepresented me again.  Ad-hominem attack means saying, "What

You persistently make frivolous arguments, disregarding the facts and

The church never said anything like that.  You are misrepresenting it,

The church's position is that condoms do wrong because they prevent

not justify misrepresenting it.

source" is a rival for mindshare, I suggest people not advocate it.

I don't use that term in judging any sort of conduct as right or
wrong.  I never did.

Thus, when you inject that them into a discussion of _conduct_ (in
this case, use of condoms) and pretend that resembles something I said,
you misrepresent me again.

You are not seriously trying to criticize what I say or what I do.
You are taking various phrases out of my statements, shuffling them,
and making bogus "arguments" that don't try to be rational.

You're wasting everyone's time.

Releasing code under the GPL is nothing

That's more false than true.  These companies create network effects
that pressure people to use the products.  Many people say they feel
they have no choice.  Of course, these companies claim that they are
"only giving people what they want".

In this particular case, some people do like the products -- they find
them convenient, and don't recognize the power that the companies have
over them.  Other people curse the same products frequently, but they
don't take the additional step to recognize that the annoyances they
curse reflect a basic systemic wrong.

You have subtly misrepresented what i said.  I said that those
programs do "computing for suckers", or that they are "software for
suckers".  (Sorry, I can't recall which.)

The point is not "You are a sucker" but "Don't be a sucker".
It condemns the proprietary developers, not their victims.

You don't have to like what I said, but you shouldn't
misrepresent it.

That is a real issue.  Proprietary software can do things that are
useful, and some of those things can't be done by free software today.

For the short term, the question is whether to use that proprietary
software or not.  I DO reject the iThing for myself, because I won't
accept the phone company's tracking or Apple's control over the
software.  I urge other people to reject it for themselves, because
that's what I would (and do) do in their place.

For the long term, the question is different.  Why is it the case that
only proprietary software is available to do that job?

I think it's because so many people accept proprietary software.  The
users, by accepting the proprietary software that exists, encourage
more work on that; meanwhile, they don't see a need to promote or fund
development of free software for that activity.

In the short term, individuals may face a choice of a proprietary
program or no program.

In the long term, society's choice is between proprietary software
and free software.  The way to choose to have free software is by
rejecting the proprietary software.

That makes no sense.  Prohibition (of whatever activity) is a means.

The _end_ of the War on Drugs is discouraging use of certain drugs.

It is the _means_, prohibition, that we object to.

Only one person in the FSF has participated in GCC development: that
is me.  But only until 1991: then I handed over maintainership to
others.  All the work since then has been done by volunteers.  (At
least, for the FSF they are volunteers.  Some of them are paid by

They have done a good job of keeping it reliable, and advanced it

I accept the apology.  The idea you've described is not what I think.
It doesn't even make proper sense, because it is a category error.
The error stems from not distinguishing between actions and positions.

It makes no sense to say one position is a "palliative" for another
position.  That concept applies only to _actions_.

Using a condom is an _action_.  The Catholic Church says that action
is evil -- that is a _position_.  I disagree with that position: I
think using a condom is (usually) good.  To call condoms "palliatives"
is stretching the term.  A palliative makes a problem less painful.
Condoms do not make problems less painful; they prevent problems from
starting, though not reliably.

Stretching the word, we could say that condom use (in general) is a
palliative for the problem of unwanted pregnancy (in general).

Using a program is an _action_.  Developing a program is also an
_action_ -- a different action.  I think it is foolish to use
a nonfree program, and bad to develop one.

At the level of actions, open source and free software largely
overlap.  Nearly all open source programs are free software.  The
exceptions are few.

Thus, using or developing "open source" programs is not a palliative
(even stretching the term) for using or developing free software.
Usually it IS using or developing free software.

At the level of positions, "open source" also stands for a political
_position_ that was formulated to reject the basic ideas of the free
software movement.  The two disagree at the deepest level.  I argue
for the free software movement's position and against the open source
position.  I use the term "rival for mindshare" to describe the
contest between these positions.

But "palliative" does not apply to positions.

http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html explains
these points.  If you want to criticize in a way that isn't confusion,
it behooves you to pay attention.

  > I should have made clearer that the GNU philosophy is paternalistic

  > copyright.

It is incoherent to compare a philosophy with a license.
It is meaningful to compare various philosophies, or various licenses.

Of course, people can work out some sort of "understanding" of the
incoherent comparison, but it will probably be a misunderstanding,
confusion rather than enlightenment.

  > I point out that, like the war on drugs, you
  > cannot set out to "save" people from themselves -- their own choices --
  > without believing that you should limit their freedom to choose.

Freedom means having control of your own life.  "Freedom to choose" is
a misguided formulation of freedom.  It is popular because it provides
businesses with a basis to smear many laws that protect people from
businesses -- including labor law, consumer protection law, home
rental law, and more.  In practice, most people have more freedom
because of these laws.

Plutocratist politicians, that serve the rich, call any law
"paternalistic" if it protects the non-rich from the rich.
"Give everyone the choice to be screwed," they say.

Implementing "freedom to choose" leads systematically to bad results
for most people.  It permits companies, which have more clout than a
typical person, to set things up so that most people have no real
option except to "choose" disadvantageous terms.

How would you like the freedom to "choose" to rent an apartment on the
condition that the landlord can put your things out on the street with
no notice, arbitrarily?

If people in Boston and Cambridge had this "freedom", pretty soon that
option would be the only one offered, and in practice most students
would be compelled to accept it.

The purpose of democracy is so that the many non-rich can join
together and set up laws that protect them from the clout and power of
the rich.  Democracy was invented specifically for that end.

pop3.el was never anywhere but in Gnus.  However, Gnus is distributed
both separately and inside Emacs.  Perhaps there was a divergence
between those two versions of Gnus.  Perhaps someone exercized bad
judgment -- in 30 years, that will sometimes happen.  Did the problem
get fixed in pretesting?

To you, this frustration seems so enormous that it makes the whole
GNU Project worthless.  To me, it isn't big enough to invalidate
the practical use of GNU Emacs, let alone the vital need for freedom.

The people maintaining Emacs now are mostly different people.
I think they are doing a good job of avoiding bugs in releases.
Nonetheless, there is probably more they could do.

It is easy to demand that others work harder or never make mistakes.
But the only way to make overall Emacs maintenance better is for
additional capable people to join in overall Emacs maintenance.

In the free software movement, we do not claim that free programs are
superior in general on practical dimensions.  Such arguments come from
supporters of open source.

What we say is that denying users' freedom is a grave flaw, which
tends to lead to malware.  All free programs are superior to all
nonfree programs on the ethical dimension, regardless of how they
stack up on various practical dimensions.

  >   But we wanted instant support, documentation and a guarantee

There is nothing wrong or foolish about paying for support, but that
doesn't mean the program must be nonfree.  We encourage selling
support for free programs, and there are companies that develop free
software and sell support.

That's one action and one philosophy.  It makes no sense to contrast them.
And both of them are unclear.  There is no comparison to be made here.
You're imposing a conceptual structure that doesn't fit the reality.

Suffice it to say that most of the time, when people release a program
under an "open source license", that license is the GNU GPL.

My experience is different.  In system development,
everybody gets lots of tiny things wrong, and has to fix them.
Our success shows we have done a good job, overall, of fixing them
and that we got some big things right.

Our main problems today are things mostly outside our control,
such as hardware whose specs are secret, and hardware
that is locked down so we can't install software in it.

To be clear, I wasn't imploring YOU in particular to help Emacs
development.  With your hard feelings, you don't want to.  But there
are hundreds of people on this list who could help.

GNU Emacs development is going strong, but there are ways to do more
and coordinate things better.

I am sorry that people got the versions out of sync, if that is what
happened, and sorry that people blamed you for errors that weren't
yours.  I know how that feels because now you're blaming me for errors
that weren't mine.

If you tell me what year this happened in, maybe I can find relevant
emails on the development list and see what went wrong.  I can't
change the past, but I might learn something useful.

We should distinguish between learning to do some programming
and being a great programmer.  Lots of people can do the former;
few can do the latter.

I got the impression from the original request that the aim was to get
a certain kid interested in programming with the hope that he would be
good at it.

Programming is accessible to a lot of people, and it is good for
people to learn as much programming as they want to.  I'm all in favor
of programmable robot toys (with free software).  I am just suggesting
that you shouldn't get your hopes up that a non-fascinated person will
become an eager or a great programmer.

I made a statement based on my own personal experience.
I don't have a scientific study to cite, and nobody else has
cited one.  It looks like personal experience is all we have.

I stated my personal experience, but I am not trying to prove it; I
have nothing at stake.  None of us can prove anything about this, it

a matter of keeping track of lots of details of interactions in the code.

I don't keep track of models of cell phones.  I am repeating what I
was told by people who know more than I do.  I did not note down
specific model names they mentioned.

The only cell phone model name I recognize is the iPhone.  I have been
told even its main battery can't be removed.  Has that changed?  I was
also told, a year or two ago, that some other models had done likewise.

If manufacturers other than Apple no longer put in any nonremovable
batteries, that is a change for the better.  Have you seen such a change
occur recently?

These three options all presume I was paying a lot of attention to the
child's gender, and did it badly.

The fact is I paid it little attention, because I did not think it was
pertinent to the issue at hand.  If I had paid attention to it I would
probably have remembered it longer.  If I had thought it made a
difference I would have checked it.

But there was no reason to do any of that.  It had no effect on what I
wanted to say.  Now that I know that child is female, that doesn't
alter anything I would have said.

Actually I don't.  This time I was mistaken about a detail that I paid

In situations like this, where a person is described anonymously in a
rough way only to introduce a general topic, we don't need to worry
about how we are treating that person.  We're not even sure there IS a
specific real person.  Maybe the description is about a hypothetical
person.

You mean, a person I had actually met???  Who had been introduced by
name???  And that was participating in the conversation???

When people call the GNU system "Linux", or say that I support "open
source", I know that (in general) it is because they were misinformed.
So I ask them nicely to get it right.

The idea that open source is "more general" than free software seems
like an instance of a widespread misunderstanding.  Many people
believe that there are lots of programs that are open source but not
free.  In fact, there are only a few.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-open-overlap.html.

The two terms are not exactly equivalent in extension, but they are
nearly so.  (This is no coincidence, of course.)

I can't stomach use of "they" for a singular anticedent.
Fortunately we already have a fine alternative.

Marge Piercy, in "Woman on the Edge of Time," used "person", "per" and
"pers" as gender-neutral third person singular pronouns that work like
"she", "her" and "hers".  They are elegant and natural extensions of
English.

I have used them in writing on a few occasions, but usually I hold
back because people might not understand them.  How about if we use
them here?  Everyone on this list will understand them now.

By the way, Spanish speakers might be interested in my
proposal for gender neutrality in Spanish.  See

  > You've had rather an uphill battle trying to make people stop calling
  > this loose collection of software you and others distribute "Linux" and
  > instead call it "GNU/Linux"

This and other efforts in my life have taught me
not to give up merely because progress is difficult.

It is true that most people still attribute our system to Torvalds by
calling it "Linux".  But the number who call it "GNU/Linux" is not
small.  (We have sold thousands metal of "GNU/Linux Inside" stickers
to people who put them on laptops.)  These people spread the word
about the GNU system, making people aware that the system comes from a
campaign for freedom.

I see no need to debate how many people I can convince.  Whether it is
more or less, it is good to do it.  So I'll do my best, and the
results will be whatever they are.

The important issue is what name people _should_ call the system.
For explanation, see http://gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html and
http://gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html, plus the history in
http://gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html.

I have never advocated "open".  That's the position of others, which

movement.

The class sounds like fun -- but it is not a good thing to ask
people to tell a company (whether Google or another) that they
are attending your class.  Please respect their privacy.

In fact, why ask people to sign up to be in the audience?  Why not
just invite people to attend if they wish?

"The option of not attending" argument stands for a controversial
political stand: that party A is allowed to impose any conditions and
these conditions cannot be criticized.  With that assumption, you
would oppose most consumer protection law, the law requiring landlords
to provide heat, the minimum wage law, and many more.  US history shows
it leads to suffering for most people.

It won't lead to such horrible consequences in this case.  My point is
only that that assumption should not be taken as indisputable.

The other three options you mention may exist, but it's not
self-evident that they do.  If they exist, why not proclaim them
directly.  That would have avoided the problem.


  > Privacy education is critical, so we can all make well-informed decisions
  > within our personal calculus.

That doesn't mean it is right for influential institutions to exercise
their influence towards more surveillance.  Those practices affect us all.

If we want a world where privacy exists, we had better organize to
insist that we are not told, "If you want privacy, you have the option
of not attending / not communicating / not using the internet / not
using the phone / etc."

  > There are any number of excellent reasons, including:  surveying the
  > would-be attendees to optimize content, estimating demand, and having
  > contact information for venue or schedule changes & disseminating advance
  > materials.

I see you have envisioned reasons why the organizers might have blocked
the other options you cited.  I did too, which is why I say it is not
self-evident these options exist.

Opposing the general danger of surveillance is an excellent reason for not 
giving in completely to these reasons and going as far as they might suggest.

  > But that freedom to decide shouldn't be denied, judged, or imposed by
  > others.

To criticize the idea of "imposing freedom" is to take a controversial
political position: rejection of the concept of inalienable rights
which is fundamental in US law.  In this context, it is also a
nonsequitur -- "denied" and "imposed" are not relevant to my message,
since all I did was raise an ethical question.

What's really off the rails is the idea that people should not "judge"
issues of freedom.  You are saying that people should not even _have
opinions_ about whether the treatment of someone else is right or
wrong.  I hope and believe that few here will agree with that
"principle".

I did not try to impose or deny anything about that event because I am
not in any position of authority over it.  Nonetheless I can state
ethical ideas about it.

The FSF as a matter of principle allows people to attend the
LibrePlanet event (March 21/22) and even pay the fee anonymously.  I
think MIT should adopt the same policy.

It sounds possibly good, but I see potential problems.

* I gather that it sends Javascript code to the user's browser.
Is that free software?

* How much information does the server get about what the user is doing?

Depending on the answers, this might be worse for your freedom than

Yes, I think we should make sacrifices for the sake of freedom and democracy,
and privacy is necessary for those.  See
http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.

Especially we should avoid leading or pressuring others to give up
their privacy, because that is mistreating them.

You may not care as much as I do about freedom and democracy,
but I won't let that stop me from campaigning for them.

People are responsible for their opinions; criticizing and even
condemning political opinions is a normal part of political discourse.

I hope academia is a hostile environment to the callousness towards
the poor and downtrodden, as well as to theocratic denial of science
and blind faith in the Invisible Hand.  Those are what you typically
find in the Republican Party nowadays.  (The Democratic Party is not

    There is a difference between criticizing a theory that somebody holds, and
    something that a person *is*.

(I said "opinions" not "theories", but the point applies to any
views.)

I agree we should not criticize something that a person *is*,
provided we are careful not to stretch the concept of "something that
a person *is*" to include "being a holder of certain views".

The previous issue was, "Do you want the rooftop garden to be privatized,
and if not, help stop it."  Your message addresses a different topic:
speculation about whether people will try enough to stop it and how big
the obstacle is.

If you want to join a campaign (for instance, to save the rooftop
garden), it is a mistake to be distracted by speculation about who
else will join you.  If you do let that concern you -- and especially,
if you give up without making a small effort just because you assume
everyone else will give up -- it amounts to a self-fulfilling
prophecy.  That's why those opposed to a popular movement will often
argue, It;'s useless to resist, so don't bother trying": they are
trying to set up a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The rational response is
to ignore them.

It was easy, in 1983, to construct such an argument that I shouldn't
bother starting the free software movement.  Most of the argument was
valid; even its conclusion was mostly true.  But there turned out to
be a big difference between "mostly" and "entirely".  Fortunately I
ignored it and tried anyway.

So don't speculate about whether your campaign will succeed.  Try it,
and maybe it will succeed.

A computerized camera watches everyone go by in the circular area.
It is connected to a machine with two displays, doing something
enigmatic and not explained.

Who put it there?  Who is in charge of it?

Maybe that machine isn't connected to the network, but we can't tell.
If it is not connected now, maybe it will be connected next week.
This is a snooping system, and we should not habituate ourselves to
such things.

That system should be moved to a place where people can play with it
_when they want to_, but where it won't watch people simply because
they going about their business in the lab.

Setting a computer with a camera to watch us IS snooping.  You can't
make that snooping ok with vague assurances that we should trust an
unknown set of people.  I am sure you say this in good faith, but a
good-faith statement from someone who doesn't have full and reliable
control over what actually happens is not trustworthy.

When our data are collected by computers, we must learn the habit
of distrust.  (See http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.)

These camera demos will be ok if you make sure they don't see people
who are just passing by and not trying to use the demo.  Otherwise,
they are snooping.

Here are some ideas for how to make them ok.

* Have a button to turn on the camera for 30 seconds.  People
who want to look at the demo can push the button.

* Move the demo to a place that people don't go for other reasons.

* Put up a wall or partition a few feet from the camera, so that the
camera sees only people that choose to walk between it and the
partition.

* Situate the camera a few feet from a wall and pointing at the wall,
so that the camera sees only people that choose to walk between it and
the wall.  The monitor could be next to the camera, or on the wall.

* Set up a camera booth, so that the camera only sees people if they
go inside.  Going in a booth is fun; people may be attracted to try
the demo.

  > camera with wording " snooping is bad"

Someone took action to block the snooping.  Good idea!

There is some similarity, and some differences.  I think the
similarity is very important -- for the sake of democracy, we must
reject systems that track people.  But the differences are significant
too.

One pertinent difference is that one of them is newly instituted and
we are in a good position to succeed in getting the problem corrected.
So let's do it!

This success may give us momentum which we can turn towards the more
difficult campaign to stop the snooping at the garage door, and with
the pox cards on the doors through which we walk.

Perhaps we can trust that person (I don't have a basis to judge), but
that would not be a reason to accept the presence of cameras in our
halls looking at us.  If this project does not record and does not
talk to the network, the next one might do one of them -- either
intentionally or by mistake.  We should not let ourselves become
accustomed to cameras in our halls.

CSAIL should handle this demo right, to get these demos started on the
right path.

It won't take more than a week to implement one of the solutions I
suggested, or perhaps some other that you'll think of.  Please take
this demo down now, and put it up again in a week in a way that treats
us right.

There is no need for this hypothetical.  Sound recorders with
sensitive microphones have existed for decades.  They have legitimate
uses, but if you start using one in CSAIL to record other people's
conversations in general, you are being very nasty and you should
stop.  Whether the recorder is built into your hearing aid makes no
difference.

Likewise for video cameras that make recordings.

The owner of a space should not have such unlimited power.  People are
entitled to respect for their rights even if they enter a store, an
office, or a lab such as CSAIL.  We should press for laws limiting
surveillance systems, in places to which the public is sometimes
admitted, which includes CSAIL.  Members of CSAIL have no obligation
to impassively accept mistreatment just because the building belongs
to MIT.

Many businesses in the US regularly cheat or mistreat their workers;
that doesn't make it right.  It's the same with surveillance.

Security cameras can be legitimate, but in order to qualify as a
legitimate security camera, it must make a local recording only and
that local recording must be overwritten automatically after a
reasonable time.

  > Objecting to (1) is objecting to FOSS principles.

It does not make sense to speak of "FOSS principles"; the idea
is incoherent.

"FOSS" tries to refer to both free software and open source (see
http://gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.html), but that doesn't
make sense when you're talking about principles.  The free software
movement stands for certain principles.  The point of the open-source
non-movement is to reject the idea of principles.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for more explanation of the difference between free software and open
source.  See also http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler for
Evgeny Morozov's article on the same point.

If you want to stand for principles of freedom in the use of software,
you should say "free software", not "open source" or "FOSS".

If we replace "FOSS" with "free software", that statement becomes
valid in spirit.  The leap from software to hardware isn't valid _as a
deduction_, but I agree that there is a lot of similarity.
See http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-hardware-designs.html
for how these principles apply to hardware designs.

I will respond in another message to the overall issue.

A security camera is NOT the same as a surveillance camera.
Security cameras can't generally track people.
Surveillance cameras can and do.

David Brin believes that our watching the powerful people will
compensate for their watching us.  I've told him for years why this
won't work.

The sharpest argument point is that it won't protect the
whistleblowers that democracy depends on: Drake, Kyriakou, Manning,
Snowden, and so many more.

But even if the state isn't looking for a way to attack you in
particilar, others might.  If everyone can try to watch everyone,
_those who start with more power gain more from this_.

For instance, if you are a typical worker, your boss has power over
you.  If your boss can watch you and you can watch your boss, that
watching is symmetrical, but the effect is asymmetrical, because your boss
can fire you, but you can't really fire your boss.  (You can quit your job,
but that doesn't leave your boss unemployed.)

I published these points in ieet.org, and Brin did not have an
answer to them.

What is the reason for doing it that way?  It has the effect of giving

It would be collect the answers directly on a CSAIL server; that would
not give any data to any company.  That is how to treat people right.

There is a right way to set up a computer system that demonstrates
some sort of imaging of the people in the neighborhood -- a way that
respects privacy.  The right way is to (1) give people an easy way to
choose whether to be imaged, and (2) inform them of their choice
before they are imaged.

The demo called "Respiration", in the circular area on floor 3, was
not set up in the right way.  It watches everyone who passes by.
There are no signs to inform people they will be imaged; but even if
people were informed, they would have no easy way to avoid it and
still get where they are going.  Depending on their destination, the
alternate route is either a long way down and up stairs, or
nonexistent.

We're informed that this computer is not connected to a network and
does not record the video.  That is reassuring for the short term,
but it is not a substitute for handling this demo the right way.

This demo is not actually snooping on us, but that fact is not easily
determined by a person walking past.  We can only take someone's word
-- those of us who have been told.  Meanwhile, further vision demos
are planned.  There could be new ones each year.  Maybe next year one
will record, or be connected to the network.  Or maybe in a few years,
when people have forgotten this discussion.  That's not to mention the
concern that cameras should cause us in other places.  We would be
unwise to habituate ourselves to trusting that vision systems don't
snoop on us.

Please take this demo down now, then set it up again the right way.

Taking it down without delay will make a clear statement that CSAIL
is serious about respecting privacy.

Setting it up again the right way won't be hard.  Here's one easy
method: place the demo computer on a stand, a couple of meters from
the wall, with the camera looking towards the wall.  A sign on the
back, facing most passers-by, could tell them about the demo and where
to walk to try it out.

I'm sure the CSAIL staff could do this in a few days.  It will be no
great loss for the demo to wait a few days to be operational again.

Please set an example of requiring that vision systems treat the lab
members with respect.  Then please publish a policy statement about
it, to urge the rest of the world to follow CSAIL's lead.

This may be a very important issue, but I don't know what it affects.
They say it has to do with "secure MIT systems such as Stellar, Atlas,
WebSIS", and others.  What do these systems do?  What does a student
_need_ them for?

If SMS is sufficient for the second factor, I think you could do that
with a phone running Replicant.  It may not actually change the
freedom situation regarding those servers.

But that situation might be bad already.  Do those services require
the visitor to run nonfree Javascript code in order to use them?

What about duo.mit.edu?  It too might have that requirement.  Does it?

What happens if you're an MIT student an you refuse to have a mobile
phone?  Do they accomodate this?

Indeed, most people don't recognize nonfree software as an injustice.
See http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html
for the explanation of why that is so.

For those of us who reject nonfree software for our freedom's sake, it
is a very bad thing if a school _requires_ students to use it.
I don't know whether these sites require nonfree software.  If they
do, it is a grave wrong.  Will MIT expel students for not running
nonfree software on their own computers?

Would someone like to check whether those sites work with Javascript disabled

In Cambridge and Medford it is possible to hear people playing gamelan

I tried to look at that, but no text appeared.  That page isn't
visible without running nonfree code (Javascript sent in the page
itself).  That is the situation with Google Docs.

Rather than directing people to run nonfree software, how about

It sounds like your app would require _all_ users to identify
themselves to your system (and therefore to the FBI).
Your system, and the FBI, would find out where _all_ of them are.

It is easy to make that better.  Simply allow MIT alums to post their
whereabouts if they wish, so the public can see who is available and
where to reach them.

This way, only _some_ of the people (those who are being sought) will
need to tell you and the FBI who and where they are, rather than all
of them.  It's still a problem, but it is less of a problem than the
other way.

I am assuming that you won't go to great lengths to identify real MIT
alums.  Thus, anyone could in practice find out who has signed up and
where.  Therefore, explicitly letting the public search really changes
little.

That would not be the case if you do go to great lengths to identify
real alums, but that would be very difficult and inconvenient to carry
out.

The purported "danger" of those ads is pure speculation.  By contrast,
overprotectionism based on focusing on the worst imaginable case is
the root of substantial wrongs.  They include surveillance of all of
us, cruel treatment of visitors entering the US, superfluous SWAT
raids that occasionally kill innocent people, and arrest of parents
(see freerangekids.com).  Also assassinations around the world (see

Running a campaign involves writing, organizing, and talking with
people to win support.  I can't help with this, but I can't take
charge, especially since I am working 60 or 70 hours a waek already.

Would you like to join in working on a campaign to demand answers from

With traditional taxicabs, it is possible to get a cab anonymously,
either on the street or via anyone's phone, and ride anonymously.  One
does not need to run any proprietary software (or any software at all)
to be a passenger.  It is also possible to pay anonymously with cash.
Basically, one can use them

Does nuTonomy permit these things?

If not, it is a step backward in terms of freedom from current-day
taxis, and noTonomy would be a more fitting name for the company.

Of course, the issue is not specific to this company.  It applies
generally to all digitally-managed transportation systems.  I don't
know how this company stacks up against the issue, but I know that the
question is crucial.

I suggest that that anyone talking with nuTonomy at the career fair
raise these issues and insist on a clear commitment to respect our
privacy.

If you can raise the issue in the hearing of other interested
students, so much the better.

Here's a handout I have distributed at events about driverless cars.
It would be useful to distribute it there.

I have a suggestion for how a hackathon ought to be run.

A hackathon is a way of giving community support to projects.  The
community ought to insist that projects act so as to deserve support,
by telling developers, "You must give the community the use of your
code in freedom (if the code turns out to be useful)."

I therefore contend that hackathons should require participants to
agree formally that if they ever release or actually use any of that
code, they will release it as free (libre) software (see
https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

Free software is a true contribution to human knowledge, while
non-free software carries restrictions that withhold it.  free
software supports the spirit of education, but proprietary software
opposes it.  See https://gnu.org/education/edu-schools.html.

It would make sense for a Massachusetts law will apply to all cars
sold in Massachusetts, or perhaps all cars registered in
Massachusetts, regardless of where the cars are made or the software
developed.  If it applied depending on where the cars were made,
it would fail to protect people in Massachusetts.

Protecting people from likely serious injustice is crucial.  The
economic interests of the businesses whose activity would cause the
injustice are a side issue.

That is the case for most commercial programs that are proprietary.

Commercial software that is free (libre) may be sold, or given away,

In an issue concerning a hypothetical dispute between some individuals
and MIT, they shouldn't ask for legal advice from MIT's lawyer.  That
lawyer cannot really give them legal advice, and ought to respond by
saying, "I can't advise you, because I have a conflct."

What the lawyer is likely to do, when asked a question, is to state
MIT's position, which is not the same thing as giving those
individuals legal advice.  For instance, the lawyer might say, "MIT
does not authorize X," and omit to mention that they don't need MIT's
authorization to do X.

It's too bad I won't be there, but what I'd say if I were there is to
advocate a new regulation that city agencies should be required to get
permission to collect, accumulate or retain any kind of personal data
about people who are either (1) identified or (2) identifiable from
that data.

Each new practice of collecting, accumulating or retaining data
should require permission.  Any any practices that were in effect
before this regulation should have to seek permission within 3 years
or be discontinued.

It is true for all copyright-based free licenses.  It is not true for
most proprietary programs because the copies are, officially, not sold.

The copyright right in _any given copy_ is exhausted when it is first
sold.  Thus, you can use _that one copy_ any way you wish, as long as
you don't copy it.

However, exhaustion of copyright on one copy does not give you
permission to make other copies.  The free license is what gives you
that.

I think it is wrong for the seller of a car to impose any restrictions
whatsoever on how the purchaser can drive the car.  The seller should
not have the power to do that.  Please don't misrepresent my views.

What you are saying is correct for old cars that don't contain
software.  It would be true for new cars if they have only free
software.

However, today's cars, full of nonfree software, probably come with
EULAs that restrict what people can do with the cars.  John Deere
tractors certainly do.  They DO restrict what parts the tractor owner
can use to repair them.

If you want to ensure that all users of your code own their copies,
you need to release under a copyleft license such as the GNU GPL.

If you put the code in the public domain, or if you release it under a
lax, permissive license (*), then anyone can convert the code into a
proprietary program with a EULA that says it is "licensed, not sold".

See https://gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.html.


* A "lax, permissive license", also known as a "pushover license", is
one that allows making the code proprietary.  For instance, the two
versions of the BSD license, and the two different licenses that some
people confusedly call "the MIT license", and the Apache 2.0 license.

See https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html for info about these
and other licenses.

That's an oversimplification -- there are various other things you
can't do.  For instance, you can't change the license of the code,
except in specific limited ways.

Thus, people should not take that statement for the whole truth.

    > Did I create a derivative work?

That is where you start misunderstand how the question would be
considered.

First a minor correction.  The correct question is not whether you
made a "derivative" work but whether your modules create a _combined_
work.  Use of that would be covered by the copyright on the original
system.

Turning to the heart of the matter: whether your modules create a
_combined_ work is a question of copyright law.  Its answer is
independent of whether the original system carries some free license
such as the GNU GPL, or not.  Rather, the answer depends on details of
the facts of the case.  There are cases where the modules and the
original system would make a combined work.

If copyright law says they are NOT a combined work, then the two are
independent works.  If so, you can do what you like with your modules
and do not need approval of any sort from the original system's
copyright holders.

If, however, copyright law says they ARE a combined work, then you
generally do need authorization from the original system's copyright
holders for what you do with the modules that you combine with it.

If the original system was released as an ordinary copyrighted work,
with no copyright-permission-granting license such as the GPL, then
you start with no permissions.  Whatever you want to do with your
modules, you must ask for permission to do it.

However, if the original system was released under the GNU GPL, then
that license gives you permission to release your modules in a
GPL-compatible way.  If you want to do that, you get pre-authorization
from the GPL.  You do not need to ask for permission for that, since
you have it at the outset.

If you want to release your modules in some other way, not
pre-authorized by the GPL, you must ask permission to do it.
Just as if the original system did not carry the GPL.

The only thing that the GPL does is preauthorize certain uses
in the cases where authorization is required.

      > A license can only be considered fully permissive if it allows
      > use by anyone for all the future without giving up any of their
      > rights.

That is a valid definition for "fully permissive", and it shows why in
most cases a fully permissive license is a bad choice for software.
It permits some users to deny other users their freedom.

For instance, one user can convert the program into a proprietary
modified version.  The users of that version end up with much less
freedom.

In other words, maximizing permission for those that receive copies
directly from you does NOT maximize it for users of that program in
general.  This is a paradox.

The way to resolve the paradox is to realize that freedom is not
synonmous with "permission to do more things".  Having the power to
deny freedom to others is not a part of freedom.

Thus we see that releasing a program under a copyleft license
maximizes freedom for the users of the program.  Using a fully
permissive license gives them less freedom, on the whole, because
it permits some users of that prpgram to deny freedom to other users
of that program.

and https://gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html.

The Marijuana Policy Project says that officials are trying to

recreational marijuana).  It says people should phone Secretary of
State William Galvin at (617) 727-7030, or (800) 392-6090 from
Massachusetts, and urge him to certify election results now so that
Question 4 will be effective on December 15, 2016 - the date that
personal possession and home grow limits are to be operative.

It also suggests phoning your state representative and senator to urge
them not to impede Question 4.

Using paperlesspost.com to send messages to us has two bad effects:

* It shows that company the message, and who it is being sent to.
There may be nothing sensitive about this particular message, if (I'm
guessing) it is about a holiday party.  But telling a company _who you
are sending it to_ disrespects those people's privacy.

* The site requires people to run nonfree software (Javascript code
in the page) in order to see the message.

I suspect one more wrong, though I can't be sure of it:

* When someone does run that nonfree program, to see the message,
I suspect it snoops on that person.

I can't see the message, so I don't know what it says, but I am sure
you can send it as an attachment in an ordinary email.  Would you
please do that now, so we can see it without running the nonfree
software?

More broadly, would you please avoid paperlesspost.com in the future,
and send us future messages as ordinary emails instead?

A series of Trump appointees are saboteurs.  Here's one that plans
to sabotage workers' rights.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/08/andrew-puzder-labor-secretary-trump-unions-wages

Trump talked about protecting US workers, but he's already screwing them.

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/12/09/hey-white-working-class-donald-trump-is-already-screwing-you-over.html

How is it that I could forecast this sort of behavior before the
election?  Not because I am specially perspicacious, but because it
was totally obvious.  I used heuristics such as

* If someone keeps contradicting himself, don't put faith in what he says.

* If he shafted lots of other people, he's likely to shaft you too.

* If he bullies lots of other people, he's likely to bully you too.

These heuristics are well known.  The people that voted for Trump are
surely familiar with them.  If they had had a lick of sense, they would
have applied their knowledge and recognized what Trump would do to them.

To talk about "stealing" in this context is comic exaggeration.  I
expect readers to recognize that, especially since the posting is so
funny.

What many readers may not recognize is that the term "intellectual
property" is bogus, and incorrect in _any_ context, because it
misrepresents the unrelated laws it is supposed to refer to.
It presents them as similar by generalizing about them, but they
are not similar and generalizing about them spreads confusion.

information, and http://gnu.org/philosophy/komongistan.html for a
funny (I hope) illustration of how completely confused the term is.

When I said that Trump supporters didn't have a lick of sense, because
they should have doubted Trump's sincerity, some people responded by
doubting that Trump was tricking his supporters.  At the time, I did
not have direct factual proof.  Since then, direct factual proof has
arrived, so I have posted a couple of times the proof that he did lie
to them.

It could, if directed at them.  Those who are not hard-core committed

has tricked and betrayed them.

However, I'm not trying to reach Trump supporters through this list.
There are not many of them here.

If Trump didn't intend to twist the Department of Labor to mistreat
workers, he wouldn't choose Pudzer to run it.

What's more, Trump wants people to know this.
He could do it less blatantly if he wanted to.

I mostly agree with you: political reasons would not justify such
action by electors.  But there are two arguably valid reasons fo the
electors to reject Trump:

* Trump's foreign business income, which includes violations of the
  "emoluments" requirement of the constitution, and which he refuses
  to fully disassociate himself from.

* Republicans rigged the election in some states through
  voter-suppression, so that Trump did not really win the electoral
  college vote.  (For details, see

    Today, over the course of the past 18 hours, a machine on the public
    CSAIL wireless network ("StataCenter"), probably on G7, G8, or G9, has
    been running a BitTorrent client serving downloads of the 2008 film
    "Kung Fu Panda".  MIT has received in excess of a dozen DMCA takedown
    notices from the copyright holder's agent regarding this activity.

Let's not close our eyes to what's really going on here.  The device
you're looking for is not doing anything _wrong_, only something
_forbidden_.  "Resistance" would be a more fitting term that "rogue".

The device was configured to run surreptitiously in order to evade the
repression.  We all understand that.  We also understand that MIT's
haste to shut off that device is because it would face harsh reprisals
otherwise.  That is collective responsibility at work, one tool of the
War on Sharing.

I don't criticize the CSAIL staff for doing what the DMCA commands.
The system's power is great, and MIT can't directly defy it.  Defying
it in this way wouldn't be effective opposition anyway.

But we must not try to bury the moral truth of the situation: unjust
power has taken MIT hostage to conscript the staff to enforce it.

Having seen this gives us a responsibility: to oppose the unjust power
in some other, effective way.  That's how we can atone for having been
compelled to uphold it.

    Apologies for sending this to csail-all; in a normal situation nobody
    except the owner of the device would have to be bothered about this.

The wish to avoid "bothering" people by showing them the DMCA at work
is understandable but misguided.  On the contrary, we, CSAIL, and MIT
should use this and every pertinent occasion to demand elimination of
the War on Sharing.  Every time we do anything to anyone under
compulsion from the DMCA, we should condemn the DMCA loudly for
compelling it.

Make sharing legal, make EULAs void, make DRM a felony!

The danger to CSAIL and MIT, and the use of people's time, are bad
results, but where does the responsibility lie?  They occurred due to
a combination of two things:

1. What the device did (sharing copies).
2. The War on Sharing, including its mechanism, the DMCA.

What moral conclusion follows from this?

The copyright industry says that sharing is in general evil and the
DMCA is legitimate.  It considers the device to blame for the two bad
results.

I say that sharing is good, and the DMCA is an injustice.  Thus, I
consider the DMCA to blame for those two bad results.

The DMCA is a law, and has existed for many years.  When assigning
responsibility for harm, people often focus on immediate causes and
exempt permanent conditions.  In a situation like this, that
systematically leads people to spare an unjust law from blame.  But
that is not valid reasoning.

You are using the same word, "license", regarding two different scenarios,
referring to different kinds of things, that play different roles.  If
swimming without trunks is illegal, should a garden without trunks be
permitted?

There are many different kinds of licenses.  They work differently,
and they have different effects.  The GNU GPL is based on copyright,
and it gives everyone the right to do more things with a certain work.
An EULA is a contract, and it does the opposite -- it imposes further
restrictions on what people can do with a certain work.

What makes either of them right or wrong is what they do to people,
not how they do it.

Neither the GPL kind of license nor the EULA kind of license is
pertinent to the issue at hand.  It is about copyright, not about
licenses.

The iTunes store does several wrongs to the user:

* It imposes an EULA which includes a promise not to share.
* It requires use of nonfree software.
* It makes the user identify perself.

The only commercial distribution of music that respects the user's
freedom is the sale of CDs in a physical store.  I do that, when I
have a chance to visit a large CD store.

  > customers know 70% of the money goes to the artist,

Does it go to the _artist_ or to the _rightsholder_?
I don't know for certain, but I suspect it is the latter.
For most well-known musicians, the rightsholder is a major
record company, and the musicians will never see a dime of the
money it gets in their name.

Regarding the claim that repressive laws are justified to keep
Hollywood afloat, does Hollywood merit such a sacrifice?  For
systematic reasons, most of its movies are crap (there are occasional
exceptions).

Many moviegoers agree they are crap.  A group of friends first decide
to "see a movie"; then they choose, among the films showing, the one
they expect to dislike the least.  They watch it expecting not to like
it much.

I therefore recommend a not-quite-boycott of Hollywood: refuse to
watch a movie unless you have some reason to think it may be good.  In
practice, it differs just a little from a total boycott ;-{.

I don't say we should force Hollywood to stop making crap.  But if its
continuation requires repression, let it sink.

I think the fault here falls on "open source" with its "pragmatism"
(its choice not to reject principle).  It says, "Isn't it nice to make
your program 'open'," and doesn't go further.  A supporter of open
source would see nothing fundamentally wrong in the use of a non-free
tool or firmware object, and would consider it a practical question.

You'd have to be quite prescient to foresee this practical problem.

The free software movement is different at the root.  It says, "A
nonfree program is an injustice to its users.  If the program you
release isn't free, it's an injustice.  If your project depends on a
nonfree tool, or nonfree firmware, that is a serious ethical flaw
in your project, regardless of who developed that nonfree thing."

    I would like to notify everyone that due to recent problems with the

    keep in mind that we (Imara, of which Communitech is an arm) have one  
    goal: to help families become more fiscally self-sufficient and   
    viable in the local job market.

While that goal is laudible, achieving it at the cost of spreading
non-free software is a net minus.  It increases a big social problem
just to help few people.

The main advantage that Microsoft has is social inertia.  This
activity makes the social inertia bigger.  Ironically, you cite
social inertia as the reason for doing so.  You are not alone.
Many institutions reason the same way, and that is the main obstacle
to the adoption of free software.

You are confident that the free software movement will overcome this
social inertia despite your working to build it up.  As the founder
and leader of that movement, my judgment is that free software will
prevail when enough institutions decide not to let social inertia
direct them into Microsoft's camp.

I hope that Imara will eventually choose a way to help disadvantaged
individuals that doesn't augment a larger problem for all of society.
Until that time, people who would like to build a better world ought
to participate in the other Imara projects but stay away from this
one.


Email is my only feasible communication method.




    I hate to chime in here, but there is another advantage of the  
    Microsoft products over the Open Office products.
    The Microsoft products are better.

If that's true (I have rarely used either one), it is a red herring.
It is always possible to make a program a little better in some
technical or practical sense.  What matters is that OpenOffice is used
by millions and it gets the job done -- and it is ethical where
Microsoft Office is not.







    I founded this program and my experience was that, for most people, 
    switching between an MS product and a non-MS product is not as easy as 
    it is for someone with (literally) a PhD in CS from MIT.

Mako Hill says he installed GNU/Linux on the machines at a high school
where he worked, and most users just went on using them as if nothing
were different.




Aznar is a crony of Bush, who sent Spanish troops to Iraq.  His party
defends the reputation of the former dictator Franco.  He failed to be
reelected because he lied about who had carried out some bombings in
Spain.

do it.

    You're of course free to criticize his decision of sending troops to Iraq,
    but you should get your facts straight on the other issues. His party does
    not defend the reputation of Franco,

According to my friends in Spain, supporters of Franco are still in
important positions in the Partido Popular, and they block attempts
to commemorate Franco's persecutions.

     and he didn't fail to be reelected
    because in the first place he wasn't running for office.

    You've said here you based this conclusion on the hearsay of your friends in
    Spain, and demonstrated that prior to this thread you hadn't actually done
    your own research on the matter.

The P.P. doesn't come right out and say it supports Franco.  The only
way to do research on this would be to travel to Spain and interview
people.  It might be a useful project, but what's needed right now
is to inform people about the background of Aznar.

The term "hearsay" pertains to trials.  If Aznar were on trial for
something, the court would call witnesses who have direct personal
knowledge of the events -- not me.  However, that's not pertinent now.




I urge people to protest Aznar both for what he did, and as a prominent
member of Spain's right-wing party.

My friends in Spain have told me that the right-wing party uses its
influence to protect Franco from criticism.  I did not take notes; I
didn't expect to have an opportunity to use them.  I have no documents
to cite.  Each person reading this message can decide for himself
whether this is enough reason to criticize the Partido Popular.

Whether or not Aznar was the candidate at the time the Partido Popular
told those lies about bombings in Spain, he was the premier, and was
responsible for telling those lies.  I think that is enough reason to
protest him personally, but each person reading this can judge that
for himself.

He also was responsible for sending Spanish troops to Iraq
to support Bush's invasion.

You seem to be grasping at straws to convince people to disregard
what I have said.  For instance,

* Misrepresenting me -- for instance, by saying I advocated "civil
disobedience".  I suggested a protest.

* Demanding I jump through hoops, such as to do research that would
take months when Aznar is coming in a few days.

* Spin, such as using the word "hearsay".

* Chiding me over quibbles, such as that "hearsay" isn't totally
limited to the context of trials in which I had heard it used before.

* Looking for personal disrespect when I am only talking about issues.

I don't like this treatment, but these things are distractionsfrom the
issue that really matters: Aznar and what he stands for, and how to
protest them.

This seems to be an attempt to deal with the problem of SaaS.
(See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-this-server-really-serve.html.)

Unhosted is a definite improvement compared with SaaS.  However, in
order for the user to have full control over her computing, she needs
to be able to run a changed version of the program.  She must not be
limited to the version that comes from some web site.

To facilitate that, it is natural to split the process of invoking the
program into two steps:

1. Obtaining the program, and putting a copy in your computer's memory.

2. Running the program from there.

apt-get is one example of an implementation of the first step.  For
the second step, you could type the program name at the shell, or
select it in a menu of applications.

Unhosted is definitely better than SaaS, but is it an improvement over
apt-get?

Because that is sarcastic, we can only guess what the point is.  In
effect you're challenging me to refute a claim you won't state.  Spit

If your claim is that the situation for GNU/Linux is the same as the
situation for data mining, that's clearly not so.  GNU/Linux is used
for all sorts of things and does not specially lend itself to bad
things.  The most important thing it does is enable you to have freedom
in using your own computer.  Occasionally it is used to bad things,
but it isn't essential for them; they could be done in other ways
(and sometimes are).

Data mining CAN be used for many things, but there's a lot of money
focused on using it for bad things -- and it is absolutely essential
for those things.  Not similar at all.

    This suggests that it is the will of the end user that is good or bad,
    not the tool itself.

You're talking about where, in principle, to assign the underlying
wrong.  I'm talking about a practical ethical question: what people
should do in this real situation.

There are useful and legitimate things that can be done with data science.
There are also well-paid bad things that can be done.  Not everyone
can get a job doing the useful and legitimate things.

Thus, people who choose a career in data science are likely to find
themselves swept by a current that leads to doing bad things.  Will
you have the moral fiber to change careers, if the data science jobs
that are offered to YOU are for marketing?  Will you draw a line
in advance and then make sacrifices as needed to stick to it, or will
you sacrifice your principles instead?

If you teach data science, and you find your students are mostly hired
to track people for marketing, will you take action to change the
results of your activities?

    If the data has already been collected, I fail to see how an improved
    understanding of that data is itself a Bad Thing.

If someone has done the wrong of collecting lots of people's personal
data, and now wants to make it pay off by figuring things out about
them and gaining an advantage over them, helping him do this seems
like a Bad Thing to me.

The NSA wants to put a back door into all systems, and it looks

    Your attitude is that of prohibition; the problem is the demand, but
    you focus on restricting the supply.

You think of people as "supply", but I'm talking to them as moral
actors who can apply moral grounds in deciding what to dedicate their
lives to.

    Why do you believe that telling people "don't learn this", "don't
    analyze this",

If you want to learn or analyze something for your curiosity's sake,
by all means do.  I'm talking about the ethics of doing a certain kind
of work _for others_.

		   or "don't earn money for your skills in this" is a
    reasonable (or even viable) solution to the problem of vanishing
    privacy?

I'm talking about avoiding doing harm with your own life's work.

Of course, avoiding harm is far short of a solution to the overall
problem.  I've described the necessary solutions in
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.

However, even though avoiding a life of doing harm is not going to
eliminate the problem as a while, it is nonetheless important.

You're attacking the idea that one person's refusal to participate in
a form wrongdoing will put an end to it, but that is a straw man which
nobody proposed except you.

Here's what personal refusal to participate CAN do:
it enables you to take a public stand against it
and not be vulnerable to accusations of hypocrisy,
It enables you to resist the tendency to decide
it's really ok so as to avoid cognitive dissonance.

This provides a basis for taking the sort of actions
that can make a bigger difference.

    Why not focus on an individual's legal ability to give consent to data
    collection?

Some surveillance systems don't ask for people's consent.
(Surveillance cameras, license plate cameras.)

When systems do ask for consent, typically that consent is a condition
for using some system, and there is a lot of pressure to use that
system.  (Mobile phones, credit cards, EZpass, cards for the locks in
our building, Facebook, Google+.)

Indeed, it's possible to refuse them; in fact, I use credit cards very
rarely, and reject the others entirely.  But I am the exception that
proves the rule.  The rule is that when people are pressured to accept
surveillance, and their only way out is to refuse one by one, few refuse.

This illustrates the general principle of democracy and collective
action: an individual alone is weak, but many united are strong.  We
need to organize to the injustice of surveillance using the state.
See stallman.org/articles/why-we-need-a-state.html.

Firm personal rejection, which can inspire others, is the first step
in doing that.

    Thinking that open source software is safe because you can read the
    source is a fallacy.

I won't defend "open source"; I was never in favor of that.
My message was about free software, which is not the same thing.
See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html.

Aside from that, you seem to be arguing against a blanket claim of
total safety, but that's not what I said:

    I'll have to agree with literal terms of your statement here. It _LOOKS_ 
    like free
    software resists better than proprietary software.  However, being able 
    to read the
    code only provides an illusion that the software is resistant to the 
    insertion
    of back doors.

When you say "resistant", do you mean absolutely, perfectly resistant?
If so, you're right, but you've changed the subject.

What I say, and what all these facts confirm, is that free software
resists insertion of back doors better than proprietary software.

The Thompson hack supports this point.  It is trivially easy to put
such a hack into a nonfree compiler.  To do it with GCC would be
harder in practice, because people compile GCC with various different
compilers and compare the output.  Not impossible, but harder in
practice.  Which is what I said.

Moreover, to insert a back door into a proprietary kernel would not
require anything as clever as the Thompson hack.  They would just put
it in the kernel's source code, which users don't have.

    It's the open source nature of software (whether free or not) that matters
    here.

That seems like a probable misunderstanding.

The difference between free software and open source is great at the
ethical level, but very small at the practical level.  Meanwhile, most
people in the software field misunderstand the definition of open
source.  Thus, in Bayesian terms, when someone claims that this small
practical difference is relevant to an issue, chances are the claim is
mistaken and it's really that misunderstanding at work.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for explanation.

It's possible you haven't actually misunderstood in this way -- I
don't know -- but surely some readers will misunderstand.

For the issue you're talking about -- Thompson's hack -- it probably
makes no difference in practice.

Free software is what matters to me, so I made my point about free
software.

You seem to be arguing against someoe who claims that free software
guarantees perfect security.  You're right, it doesn't.  (The Lisp
Machine software wasn't free software anyway, which is part of why I
quit my MIT job and developed GNU.)

Looking at other people's screens was considered legitimate in the AI
lab in 1980.  This feature was not a secret.  It imitated similar
features on the PDP-10, which were documented (as much as other
features were).  Anyone could spy on anyone, and lots of people did.
(These machines belonged to the lab, not to individuals.)

The situation today is different, and such a feature would be removed
from free software.  Users have a better chance of spotting such a
feature in a free program than in a nonfree one.

And, as you stated. they can remove it from a free program, whereas
they can't remove it from a nonfree one.

      However, in the case of the screen spy, if the 
    software were free, you could easily remove or disable it when you found 
    out about it (although some new law could put a stop to that).  For open 
    source software, you may have fewer  options.

I don't know of any such law, but this looks to me like an instance
of a common misunderstanding about the definitions of free software
and open source software.  Nearly all free programs are open source;
if you think there are many programs which are open source but not free,
you have probably been misinformed about the definitions.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for how the definitions compare.

    It's worth noting that, while making the *software* freely
    available is laudable, making the *data* freely available isn't so
    clearly right. Those data are personal medical data;

We're talking about different data.

I'm talking about the data base that they aim to develop, which
relates symptoms to conditions.  This is not personal data; it is not
about anyone in particular.

    Minor tangent: Does the FOSS community maintain some kind of infrastructure
    (or ad-hoc 'standard' central repository) for hosting open mobile apps or

Before responding, I have to point ourt that I don't advocate making
apps "open".  "Open" is the slogan of people who disagree with me.
I have nothing to do with that.

MIT has invited the head of Apple, Tim Cook, to speak at commencement.

Apple makes DRM, and pioneered the practice of building computers to
censor installation of applications.  Its operating systems transmit
data about user activities.  (See
https://gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html.)  Some recent
Macintoch models have trouble running GNU/Linux because of secret
specifications.

Apple is also a champion of planned obsolescence and e-waste.  Someone
from that company is a good choice of speaker.

It seems to me that it would be appropriate to protest the talk in
nondisruptive way, perhaps by printing and handing out copies of
http://stallman.org/apple.html.  However, I can't organize an action
myself because I will be out of town.

Is anyone interested in organizing an action to protest Tim Cook and Apple?

The word "consume" doesn't fit the reading of articles.  One of the
good things about news articles, whether distributed in web pages or
printed on paper, is that reading it doesn't consume it.

"Consume" is a term that comes from economics, and applies to
commodities.  So the meaning conveyed by its use is to treat news
articles as a commodity.  I think that's worth an effort to avoid.

This is not meant as criticism of you or your experiments or your

To speak of "consuming" works of authorship is a recent practice which
I never saw until a few years ago.  It still stands out and makes a
very specific statement about values.

My point is that these values are flawed -- they treat works of
authorship (news articles in this case) as a commodity.  Let's please
think about whether that is a good idea to promote.

Dictionaries are descriptive, not prescriptive.  If people continue
using that construction, dictionaries will surely mention it sooner or
later.

But that won't make it a good thing to say.

The description of the service raises some ethical questions.  I can't
tell the answers from the information stated, but it seems strange to
speak of "bringing targeted marketing and data analytics" to a field.
It is not clear to me that these are things musicians and music lovers
want, or should want.

The ethical questions are:

* Will it be possible to use this service without identifying yourself?
  (See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.)

* Will the service give some other company or agency information about
  its visitors?  (For instance, via a Facebook Like button.)

* Will it be possible to use this service without running nonfree software?
  For instance, will any JavaScript software that the site sends to users
  carry a free license and point to its source code?
  (See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html.)

What are the answers?

    . On GNU/Linux  systems [if you call them GNU/Lunix you should put the
      trademark symbol there because Linux is a trademark of Linus Torvalds]

I think that is a mistake.  You haven't said whether "should" stands
for a legal requirement or an ethical imperative, but as far as I know
it is neither one.

There is no legal requirement to write "TM" after a name just because
it is a trademark.  Many other trademarks have been mentioned in this
discussion, including brands of cameras and names of stores, without a
"TM", and that's fine.  "GNU" is a trademark just as "Linux" is, but
there is no legal requirement to write "TM" when you write "GNU", or
when you write "Linux".

Businesses may have reasons to use the "TM" symbol in their commercial
publications, but those reasons don't apply to a discussion like this
that isn't commercial.

As for ethics, I don't see any ethical issue at stake.

Last time I bought a camera, I bought it from B&H.  I went to the store
and paid cash for it, so that Big Brother did not know about it.

    . Magic Lantern is GOLv2'd Free software for canon EOS cameras;
      http://www.magiclantern.fm/

Last I looked, it was not a complete replacement for the camera's
firmware, just an add-on.  Which means that in ethical terms, it is
not a solution.

A camera for which changes in firmware are not normally done at all
would avoid the issue.

    Is there a form of registration that doesn't tell the person/organization
    running an event that you are going to go to the event?

It's not merely possible, it is trivial.  Just invite the person to
make up some text rather than give a name.

Or give the person a code with which to prove registration, without
asking for the person's name.

    Isn't that the very
    meaning of registering for an event?

I thought the very meaning of registration was to reserve a place in
the event.

    Or are you only objecting to the fact that there is an intermediary doing
    the bookkeeping?

That makes it worse, of course.

     Or that that bookkeeper would tell the government on demand?

That makes it even worse.

The best way to avoid these sorts of misuse of data is not to collect
the data.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.

Nobody is "on the hook" for people that don't attend the event.  There
will be approximately 7 billion of those no matter what you do.  If a
handful of them register before not attending, that won't make any
difference, if the event is planned properly.

Or are you suggesting that the event should aim to make money from
non-attendees?

The FSF ran its annual Libre Planet event a month ago.  It was a big
success, and we did this without requiring people to pay in advance.

Using the term "cloud" generally encourages confusion.  If you want to
understand any given scenario, and evaluate it in terms of whatever
criteria, you need to see what it consists of.  That is hard to do
while your vision is blocked by the "cloud".

Turning to the substance of what is discussed in that article, I
suspect that it involves (1) running nonfree software in the user's
machine, (2) collection of data about the user which the US government
can then study, and (3) Service as a Software Substitute (see
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html.)
I don't know enough facts to claim that all three of these will occur
in every usage scenario, but those issues certainly arise.

    Most events do not have big budgets and are barely able to
    make ends meet at all, let alone being able take large financial risks on
    no-show registrants.

That argument assumes the organizers are being very foolish.  If you
want to run an event and you don't have money to burn, your rational
course is to minimize what you spend on individual attendees.

That way, the only financial risk is the fixed cost of having the
event at all (expenses of the space, fees and expenses of speakers,
etc).  Your ability to recoup this depends on whether _enough_ people
attend (and pay), not precisely _when_ they pay.

Some events have separate advance-registration for an activity such as
a banquet which involves per-attendee expense, but not for the event
as a whole.

I can see how your project would be of practical convenience
to the people you aim to serve.  At the same time, I have to raise
the question of what sort of system you're planning to include them in.

Is it a system in which their purchases are tracked by companies
which will make the information available, one way or another, to
large multinational corporations and to states?  See
https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html.

Is it a system where they have to carry a Stalin's Dream device which
tracks their movements all the time, and could be set to listen to the
conversations around them as well?  See
https://gnu.org/malware/malware-mobiles.html.

I think what people deserve are systems that they can use with strong
anonymity, so that no one can even determine that today's transaction
and tomorrow's transaction were carried out by the same person.

We could put an end to planned obsolescence for mobile phones
by requiring them to be sold with a 5-year warranty.

However, planned obsolescence is not the worst thing about them.  It
is merely a wasteful expense.  They track the user's movements and can
be remotely modified, through a universal back door, to listen to all
the conversations in the vicinity.  With proprietary software playing
an essential role, users have no chance of making them secure.

For those reasons, I would not carry a Stalin's Dream device even if it
were offered to me gratis and would probably keep working for 20 years.

I got this information about the Boston climate strike tomorrow.

======================================================================
We’re planning on having the strike in front of the state house in
that semicircle area, with the speaker etc. on the main
steps. However, if we get enough people, we will have to spill over
onto Boston Commons (the part right across from the state house main
entrance).

The strike is from 11 am to 3 pm. Many people will be staying this
whole time; however, other people will be just coming for a section of
it if they are unable to do the whole thing. Check out the schedule if
you want to know more: From 11 to 12 we will have a chants, songs, and
youth speakers. At 12 to ~12:30 and we will have a brass band,
networking with other environmental organizations, pizza, etc. Then we
will go inside the state house for some lobbying. And at 1:30 it will
be a town hall in Room 437 in the state house where people can
questions the panel of five state legislators.

Your wsb site is meant as a path to participate in events that will
have a social impact.  However, the site itself has a social impact,
one that you may not have thought about.

I visited the site, blocking nonfree Javascript for my freedom's sake
as I always do.  See https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html.

In the front page, gaps suggest that some things did not show up, but
I think they were not crucial.  The Apply Now button appeared and its
navigation did work.

However, it led me to a page that didn't function at all.  It depends
totally on nonfree Javascript.  People who won't surrender their
freedom cannot apply.

For some information, the site refers visitors to Facebook.  Many of
us resist surveillance by choosing not to be used by Facebook, and our
ability to see what is posted there is limited.  I did see mention of
an event that referred people to a Google form to RSVP.  I tried
visiting that page, and Google asked me to log in (I think -- the page
was in German).  None of the buttons did anything.

This adds up to a social impact -- a negative one.  It promotes
acceptance of nonfree software, which denies freedom to those who run
it (see https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html)
and acceptance of surveillance capitalism.

I would guess that these effects are not the intended effect of the
activity.  Would you please fix those aspects of your site so as to
avoid them?

signing up requires running nonfree software (Javascript code sent to

You're right that one must always suspect a nonfree program of
harboring malicious functionality.  There is no way to rationally
justify trusting it.

The way we demonstrate that this risk is important, not merely
a theoretical possibility, is by specific documented examples
(see http://gnu.org/proprietary/).  So I am always looking for
more of those.

If you find an example of a malicious functionality, documented
by the press or by someone's published testimony, which is not
listed in http://gnu.org/proprietary/, please mail it to
webmasters at gnu.org.  We would like to add the reference.

That's not true for an email.  Perhaps you are thinking of web browsing?

If you browse the web with Javascript disabled, and use Tor so they
can't tell your real IP address, in general they can't distinguish you
from all the other people who do things that way.  It isn't perfect,
but it is partly effective.

It is much better than letting them identify you to their hearts' content.
Don't reject an improvement for being imperfect.

I think you are extrapolating incorrectly.  Canvas fingerprinting
depends on Javascript.  Once you turn Javascript off, they can't do
that at all.  Thus, users become less distinguishable.

I use Tor with IceCat.  IceCat provides false information to the web
site for some things.  This is designed to make IceCat users less
distinguishable -- from each other, and even from users of other
browsers.

  > Tor's strength derives from all users appearing identical to trackers,
  > be they advertisers or governments,

That is a very strange way to think about Tor.  I won't say it is
_wrong_, because I don't even see how it makes sense.

My reason for using Tor is so that the ISPs looking at me and at a server
cannot tell that we are talking to each other.  I don't think the strength
of this protection depends on how anything appears to "trackers."

I think we are miscommunicating so deeply that the details hardly matter.

					including (but not limited to)
  > having the same canvas fingerprint.

I find that claim implausible.  Browser fingerprinting attempts to
measure things about the platform, not just the browser itself.  How
could the Tor browser hide those differences?  It would not be easy.

If the Tor browser developers clearly say that it does that,
I will believe them.

  > If you disable JavaScript then you

That is true to some extent.  The size of the pool that a semi-hostile
site can't distinguish me from may be smaller.  It is not inevitably
smaller, but I expect it is smaller in today's conditions.

  > Which further differentiates you from the typical Tor user.

But it makes me more similar to the typical IceCat user.

If indistinguishability from a large pool were the whole and only
goal, the path I have chosen may be a slower one.  But my goal is
bigger than that.  Resisting tracking by sites is only part.

I reject nonfree JavaScript code because it would deny my freedom, as
any nonfree program does.  I don't allow nonfree software to run on my
computer.  See https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html.

The FSF is therefore trying to build a different pool of indistinguishable
users: people who use IceCat and don't run nonfree JS code.


A secondary issue, about security: running JavaScript on your computer
makes you vulnerable to SPECTRE attacks.

One pertinent question to ask about each of these activities

Not just the specific educational software and student programming
platform, but also the system.

That's because following users is not a surveillance mechanism.
Rather, it is a way of using surveillance data.
So it doesn't really fit into this conversation
about how browsers can block various surveillance mechanisms.

If you say which surveillance mechanisms this uses,
I could find out whether Icecat blocks them, and whether
we can block them.

					  The Tor network alone can't

Icecat does block some methods of fingerprinting.

To block JS fingerprinting by blocking some JS constructs is
inevitably going to make the user distinguishable from those who don't
block them.  It is no use criiticizing both options because each one
is imperfect.

A few years ago I talked with them about the possibility of merging
the Tor Browser with IceCat, but they were dead set against blocking
JS, whereas for us that is absolutely required.  Thus, we could not
cooperate.

Now that they accept the need for the feature of blocking JS, maybe
cooperation is possible.

Can you put me in touch with whoever would now be good for me to talk
with, there?

It should be noted that Redis has made some of its add-ons
proprietary.  It says "(e.g. RediSearch, Redis Graph, ReJSON,
Redis-ML, Rebloom)".  Perhaps others.

I have never used Redis and I don't know how important those add-ons
are, but it sounds like they are.  Does anyone here know?

This is a very bad change; see
https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2018/aug/22/commons-clause/.
I urge people to shun Redis or else make it tolerable by writing
free replacements for some of those add-ons.

I don't know concretely what activity is veiled by those abstract

The sad thing about this is that they may be saying the same thing

I'm not sure what "closed" means here.  If it means non-free components,
Replicant does not contain any.  Its developers are very strict about

The Replicant developers are responsible for what Replicant contains.
It contains only free software, and it does run in that form on some platforms.

If users decide to add nonfree software to Replicant -- whether they
be 5% of the users or 95% -- I'd say that ill-advised.  But the users
who do this are the ones responsible for doing it.  Not the Replicant
developers, who are doing their level best to help people avoid
nonfree software.

A factual statement that some people act a certain way can easily be
interpreted as legitimizing it, even if strictly speaking it doesn't
speak about that question.  Perhaps that statement could use
clarification to avoid that interpretation.  Would you please tell me
the URL you found it in?

You may be right that Replicant inherits technical flaws from Android,
but nonconstructive criticism isn't useful.  Can you suggest a way to
get a technically superior and _free_ operating system for mobile
devices?  That would be constructive criticism.

I think that would be ideal, if it works well and users like it.  But
I would be satisfied as regards free softwware if Replicant works well
and users like it.  Free software has to be the first priority -- once
we have got rid of the nonfree software, and thus have security against
the manufacturer, we can work on security against third parties.

To reduce the information Big Brother collects from T riders,
it is good to swap charlie cards from time to time.

I have several slightly used, empty charlie cards on hand.  Come to my
office, room 381, from 10am to 4pm on Wednesday, if you would like
one.

I'd also appreciate it if you'd drop off additional empty charlie
cards, either Wednesay or any time.  Just slide them under my door if
I'm not in.

If you have a charlie card that isn't empty, you can come on Wednesday
and pick up a new one for future use.  When your old card becomes
empty, switch to the new one and give me the old one.  I'll use it
and/or circulate it.

An RFID can be scanned at any time, so keep your charlie card
in a pouch of aluminum foil or mylar except when you use it to
pay for traveling.  And never use anything but cash to refill one.

Remember, only you can keep Big Brother in the dark.

You're bending over backwards to excuse the TSA agents totally from
responsibility for what they do.

Morally, there is no difference between doing X as a job or doing X as
a whim.  If X does wrong to someone, getting paid to do X does not
make it legitimate.

Only the wealthy and the powerful can hire staff to be callous to the
public on their behalf, rather than doing it directly themselves.
Thus, if we accepted "Don't blame me, I'm just doing my job" as a
justification for treating the public badly, we'd give the wealthy and
powerful an all-purpose excuse to mistreat people -- by hiding behind
their employees.

Agents of the Theater of Security Agency have not been conscripted or
forced to do that job.  They are personally responsible for what they
personally do, just like every other person.

The agents are in a position of power vis-a-vis the passengers.  Humor
is a way for the powerless to push back, so I use humor.

  > not into subversion of the

To call the resistance by the powerless "harassment" of the powerful
turns the concept of harassment inside out and backwards.

I reject the idea that we should pity the people who are hired to
control us, and avoid making them uncomfortable as they do so.  It
lets them (directly) _and_ their employers (indirectly) off the hook.
In effect, we would hamstring ourselves in pushing back against
official mistreatment.

Certainly the employers are the ones mainly responsible for the
mistreatment.  But they have arranged not to be present when that
happens.  Our only easy opportunity is to push back against the bad
practice is to push back against those who are paid to do it.

Nobody is coerced to work for the TSA.  Only a tiny fraction of US
workers work for the TSA.  If they feel ethical qualms about their
job, they should quit.

This raises a broader political issue, much more important than
my way of teasing TSA agents.

One of the dangerous things about the TSA, and "security" enforcers in
general, is that agents can stretch definitions, taking molehills for
mountains, as excuses for acts of repression.

You've said that my teasing might be an occasion for them to do so.
Perhaps it is (though that's not the impression I get in practice).
If you're right, what does that imply?

Rather than noting the injustice of such action, your message seems to
legitimize it.  It exhorts me to keep silent out of fear of abuse of
power, but shows no sign of criticizing those who would do the
hypothetical repression?

Is it good for society for people to exaggerate the likelihood of
disproportionate repression of their speech, and avoid it by
self-censorship?  What about people who think of stating support for
Black Lives Matter, or the Women's March?

Should we legitimize the repression of such speech?

This brings us back to the original topic: how to deal with
unaccountable repression carried out by agents of the state in an
airport, "justified" by minor harmless things.

(Does that official have any say over the TSA?  I doubt it.)

I tease TSA agents about this because it is quick and easy, and
therefore feasible.  To go to a protest is a lot more work, so I can
only do that for issues I give high priority to.  TSA "pat downs"
isn't one of my high priority issues, even in the airport security
area.  I talked about it only because someone else brought it up.

I am not the only one who decides based on what's easy.  On-the-spot
pushback is important because many people will do it.  Far fewer
people will object to anything, if they have to organize the objection
for later and spend time on it.  Limiting objections to those planned
for later is therefore an effective way of damping them down. 

Thus, we must reject the supposed principle that we must always be
polite and respectful to those who take pay to mistreat the public.
That approach is often useful useful in a protest, once a protest is
organized, but it is not a principle.

The TSA agents that take pay to feel people's bodies, like the W3C
that takes pay to support DRM, are the legitimate butt of rudeness.

I say this to screeners when they insist on feeling me up.
It points out a truth which they can't deny, but in a comic way.

Rather than expressing resentment of what they are doing, as they are
accustomed to, I pretend to be eager for it.  I ask only for a change
in one little detail which is irrelevant to security.  Alas, that
change is against their rules.

By that loose standard, you inflicted harm on me by sending me your

standard must be rejected.  It conflicts with freedom of speech.

The reaction surprises me -- people are reading into my little bit of

I don't assume anything about what they think, but I hold them
responsible for what they do.  If they don't agree with those
policies, they should stop carrying them out.

  > avoid a message that uses stereotypes as a punchline.

This joke could be seen as referring to a stereotype: "All men want
sex from anyone in the group they are attacted to, at any time."  It
doesn't directly say that things would be different if I were a woman;
it's only that I am male, and the stereotype about males is well
known.  But I think it is ok if people think of that stereotype, since
in this context it is self-mockery.

The joke cites the fact that some of these men are gay and attracted
to males, while others are straight and attracted to females.  Aside
from that, it the two groups as alike.  Nonetheless some seem to
perceive that as prejudice against gay men.

Someone privately suggested other wording that would express the same
point without referring to the two orientations.  I will think about
using those words in the future.  It's worth changing the joke to
avoid its being misunderstood as prejudiced against gay men.

I do not approve of prejudice against gays, and my joke does not
express prejudice against gays.  (I've already explained why.)

However, a certain segment of people tend to misunderstand it in that
way.  There must be an unclear point in the joke which is vulnerable
to this particular misunderstanding.

That is an unfortunate result.  I don't want to have the effect of
promoting a position I actually oppose.  I also regret hurting the
feelings of gays who perceive it as prejudiced against them.

I will try to tell the joke in a clearer way in the future, so it
won't be misunderstood as prejudiced against gays.

With all due respect, that is not what it says.  To suggest that an
example of A may, on occasion, also be an example of B is not
conflating A with B.  The joke does the former but not the latter.

This joke is not unique in presenting such a fictional possiility.
Some highly successful books and movies present it too.  If a movie

movie should not have been made?

    This is pretty much what a man with drug-resistant TB did. He wanted to
    get back to the US from overseas, but he got stuck on the "no-fly" list
    and had his passport flagged. So, he flew to Canada, drove to the
    border, the guard scanned his passport, and then the guard let him in
    since the guard didn't think he looked sick.

As a US citizen, he has a right to return to the US somehow.

I read in 2004 that there was evidence that Dubya's campaign stole the
Ohio election (and thus the overall result) using OCR ballot readers.
In the counties that used them, there was a systematic discrepancy
between the results and the exit polls, in Dubya's favor.  In the
counties that didn't use them, there was no discrepancy.

I don't remember why that election wasn't verified by a recount, but
the reason is pertinent.  If recounts are going to be done, rigging
the scanning machines might not be an effective way to cheat.  In
practice, there are sometimes obstacles to recounts.  It would be
useful to see why there was no recount in Ohio, and talk with an
organization that campaigns against election rigging in the US, to
find out whether there are obstacles to recounts in California.

Also see if Greg Palast knows of anything pertinent.  He investigates
election rigging in the US.  His focus is the disenfranchisement of
members of Democratic-leaning groups, which happens on a large scale
(http://us4.campaign-archive2.com/?u=33e4ec877eed6a43863a4a92e&id=390768b5d5&e=8283eff9b8),
but he might know something about this.

Indeed, extreme paranoia is a standard fallacy excuse for dismissing

* Why bother demanding free software, which is the opportunity to
  avoid spyware and fix bugs?  There's still a chance users might
  overlook some spyware or bug.

* Why bother wearing a seat belt?  There's still a chance an accident
  could kill you.

* Why bother inspecting the airplane every 100 flight hours?
  There's still a chance something could disastrously fail.

It's a general argument for "What, me worry?"  Nobody believes or

selectively to oppose some precaution that does a certain amount of
good.

I won't be attending the event -- I don't work in that field, and I'll
be out of town anyway -- but I wrote to events at selfassemblylab.net to
ask them not to use Eventbrite.  Using Eventbrite has two ethical
shortcomings: (1) it means that participation is surveilled by a
company which makes the data available to the state, and (2) it
requires requiring nonfree software to register.

To those who do plan on attending, would you like to support this
request by sending them mail?

30 years ago, MIT had a ride board.  People could stick pieces of
paper on the hooks on the board, to invite others to share rides and
driving with them.  Big Brother knew nothing about who was travelling
or where, unless they sent an agent to copy down the info.  I used
this a couple of times to join trips from Boston to San Francisco.
The US government probably did not know I was going there.

Zimride, by contrast, is required by the PAT RIOT Act to give the FBI
any and all information that it has about any users.

How much information does Zimride keep about a user?

If a user offers a ride, the system has to record that in order to
show it to other users.  That's already pretty bad.

Does it record which ride offers a user tries to accept?
Does it record which ride offers a user looks at?
I guess that it does, because standard engineering practice is to
record and save all data, and this is not so much data that it
becomes hard to store.

Is it possible to use Zimride at all without identifying yourself
to the system?  I would guess it is not, though I don't know.

If things are as I expect, the FBI finds out, for its latest version
of Total Information Awareness, all about everyone who expresses on
Zimride any kind of interest in any kind of travel.

These are guesses, and might be wrong.  I hope they are wrong.  I
would be glad to be surprised and find out that Zimride arranges to
collect no personal information about people who look at ride offers,
and helps them answer the offers through some other channel.  But that
would be a big surprise.

I have cc'd the person who made the announcement.  Perhaps he can give
concrete answers about these points.  However, he's can't tell us how
often the FBI collects data from Zimride, because the PAT RIOT act
forbids them to tell anyone.

I give to the ACLU every year, and I sign their petitions, but if we
want victory for civil liberties we must not leave the job to them.
We need to campaign for civil liberties in our own lives.

    Clearly your complaint is with the Patriot Act, and not with Zimride.

There is enough blame to go around for all parties involved.

The US government is responsible for adopting the
U. S.A.P. A.T. R.I.O.T. Act (the name is an acronym, so that way of
subdividing it into words is just as valid as any other ;-).

Those who run Zimride are responsible for not trying to minimize the
personal info that is collected about users.  On the contrary (thanks,
Neil), they collect info for many companies.

Those at MIT who encourage people to use this system instead of the
old ride board are responsible for doing so.

MIT has the opportunity to do good instead of harm.  It could set
the goal of replacing Zimride with something that respects privacy.

I think people in CSAIL can design a ride-sharing board that collects
much less personal information.  Perhaps none at all, if it uses
encryption and Tor.

All it takes is for MIT to make this a goal.

I think you're exaggerating when you describe Tor.  When you're going
to identify yourself to a site, it is pointless to use Tor, so don't
use it for those sites.  The point is to use Tor for other anonymous
browsing.

    then someone using Tor is putting themself in the 
    same pool with child pornographers, which gov't has a blank check to go 
    after, and some of the "potential subversives" that have a long history 
    of being monitored.

We are already in the same pool: the United States.
Big Brother does a lot of monitoring of everyone,
and Tor can block some of that.

To do further monitoring they would need a reason, and using Tor
isn't a reason by itself.

    > To do further monitoring they would need a reason, and using Tor

    I'm guessing that, on average, people using Tor are more interesting to, 
    say, counter-terrorist efforts, than are people not using Tor.

They can't get a search warrant based on that.
What they can do without a warrant, they aim to do to everyone.

Fundamentally, your argument is based on prioritizing the narrow and
short-term over the general and long-term, and its conclusion is
"Don't take the risk of resisting even lawfully."  It is a counsel
of defeatism.


    Right now, for most people, browsing anonymously on the Web is almost 
    impossible.

For me it's automatic.  I use various computers, each of which is used
by others as well, and I don't identify myself to sites.  I deactivate
Javascript since it is usually nonfree software, but this means that
malicious tracking Javascript can't run.  Cookies are all discarded
after the session.

    You still get tracked by images during a single session, unless you use
    a browser that disables automatic image loading, or that does not send
    the HTTP "Referer" header.

Yes, they can do that.  However, at least they can't associate this
with me.

We're making IceCat block other-site images etc. to prevent this.

     Even then, some sites will use URL rewriting
    in order to try and keep track of you.

I looked at Zimride's terms of service and found many things
that are either inconvenient or unethical or both.

Inconvenient:

* They charge for this service.  Using the old ride board
  did not cost anything.

* You can't pay in cash or anonymously.

Misleading:

* The contract uses the misleading term "intellectual property".
  Any use of that term spreads confusion:
  see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html.

Unethical:

* They require people to give lots of personal information,
  and to promise that it is accurate.

* They collect "demographic" information, essentially a lot
  of personal data, as a profile for users to search.
  Of course, they can use this in other ways -- and it is
  mandatory.

* They have a license to use this information forever.

* They forbid sending any kind of contact info to other users through
  the site, until they tell you to.  This seems like a scheme to keep
  control over all communication for longer and collect more info.

* They say they can change the terms without warning and you're bound
  automatically by the new terms whether you saw them or not.

* They forbid disassembling their software; I guess this
  means they send nonfree Javascript code to run on the
  user's machine, because the user would have no access
  to software that runs on the server.

* I can't check, but I hazard a guess that the site won't work
  if the user doesn't run that nonfree software.

    This is not completely true.  Tor also provides location privacy, so
    that, for example, you might log into Gmail through Tor in order to
    avoid revealing to Google where on the internet you are, and to avoid
    revealing to your ISP that you're logging into Gmail.

I stand corrected.

There must be thousands of opportunities to do things along those

describe "fusion centers" as a project of this kind, and they exist.
So it is conceivable that something was set up to identify the user of

But I don't think it is very likely.  I think this is an example

A few might be motivated to do some challenging project, I agree.  But

that simple measures can't reduce the data SOME surveillance systems get.

I'm tryin to do exactly that, by raising the issue of surveillance
here and in many other places, and by promoting ways of blocking some
surveillance systems.  Of course, they can't block all surveillance
systems.  But they do some good, and by doing them, people learn
to pay attention to the issue.

Any time I hear about a plan for a "smart city", I suspect it will
involve track people.  What will these sensors sense?  Could they
violate our privacy?

If the contest is looking for all sorts of sensors, and does not have
rules to assure that they WON'T violate our privacy, surely some of
the candidates will do so, and that is enough to make the contest a
predictably harmful activity.

The fact that they engaged a massive surveillance company (eventbrite)
to track participants in their event shows that they are not making an
effort to avoid augmenting surveillance.  That attitude bodes ill.

It is an improvement because I avoid running any nonfree software.
I deserve to have control over the software on my machine.

I don't expect, want or deserve to have control over someone else's

does is his.  He's the one who deserves control over the software on

There is nothing to "figure out".  The issue with that nonfree

are nonfree.  If you want freedom, you need to reject them.

Maybe so, but I think it is unwise to run our applications
straight off someone else's server.  And certainly not if they
are proprietary software.

The freedom-respecting ways to do these jobs is to release
a free program that people can install on their desktops.

It would not address the problem.  The VM would have no effect on many
kinds of snooping and fingerprinting.

More fundamentally, it wouldn't make those programs into free software.
They would deny our freedom just like any other nonfree application program.

I think that won't be so.  Since this interface will be simple,
bare-bones not pretty, the code can be a lot simpler.  Doing all the
work on the server avoids the difficulties of coordinating code
on two different machines.  Also, if you write the HTML-only interface
once the site is basically ready, you won't need to implement all
the stages of development.  I think you will find it is a small
fraction of the work of developing the pretty interface.

I think most of the new code needed will be for detecting
syntactically invalid arguments, which normally the JS code would
prevent.  For instance, if the user enters a date using a text field
need to validate it.  But how hard can that be?  Just try converting
it, and display the date that you got, so the user can check it.

Javascript code can be executed on the server.  Maybe part of the job
can be done by copying the Javascript code from the pretty interface.

When we want to avoid doing something, we often mentally inflate how
much time it will take.

Have you implemented an HTML-only interface for some part of your site
functionality?  How long did it take?

I don't think that statement makes sense -- at least, not about the
issue I am talking about.  What would it mean to "have people" not do
this?  And in what sense "not viable"?

The only sense that I can find for those words is that you think I
have a plan to _direct_ a lot of people to do this (they could be my
employees), and you claim that some practical problem would result.

I am sure you don't mean that.  You know I don't have such a plan, or
lots of employees to carry it out with.  But I can't find another
coherent meaning for your words.

I _urge_ people to refuse to run nonfree Javascript code, and there
are people who refuse this, either always or sometimes.  I don't see
any sense in which it is "not viable".  It is viable _for us_.

I also urge web developers to make their sites function with JS disabled.
Some of them do that, and it is clearly viable for them.

All those technical desiderata are hard, and mistakes are frequent.
Technical factors such as the choice of programming language can
make for a greater or smaller frequency of mistakes.

When it comes to nonfree code in web pages, a greater or smaller
chance of bugs is a minor issue compared with the inevitable inherent
problem with the very idea.

As with any optimization, it only occasionally makes a big difference.
The computation that would move to the server is mostly checking for

Freedom isn't free.  If we prefer to shun JS code despite some
slowdown, why should you object?  We do not insist you pay this price
for freedom (though I think you'd be well advised to do so); we want
the option of doing so ourselves.

In non-JS interfaces, you generally enter a lot of data in a form,
then click a button to send it all.  So the number of redisplays is
generally not so large.

It solves the specific problem stated in the previous message.  But

Rejecting nonfree software is necessary so we can control our

There is no "cloud" -- it runs in someone's server.

Entrusting our own computing to someone else's server is a practice we
call "Service as a Software Substitute".  It is ethically equivalent
to running a nonfree program, so one should avoid it.

See http://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html.

When I want to talk with you, I don't mind having my computer talk

That could do SOME good -- it would perhaps limit how much the JS code
could track my actions and fingerprint my machine.

But I still would not have control of the computing it does, so it does
not get rid of the injustice.

In this scenario, the "rescuer" protects you from one thief, then

judge the two acts in combination.

I think Deven is correct, since they are two separate acts -- the
first one does not compel or require the second.

Whatever the conclusion about this case, it is too different from
the issues about software; it does not illuminate them.

Of course, people have different values -- but those differences, in
this issue, are not the main source of disagreement.  Most people
value freedom more or less -- it's just that many of them have not
reflected on the consequences of using nonfree software.  They see
only the convenience.

That is no accident, of course.  The media-industrial complex
systematically teaches that way of seeing things.

We see evidence all around.  Lots of computer users say they do care
about the loss of freedom and privacy.  Users often get incensed about
the specific malicious functionalities that are a consequence of
nonfree software.

If they understood that these bad things are the systematic result of
nonfree software, _some_ of them would reject _some_ nonfree software.
That is a step forward.

We are miscommunicating fundamentally.  I'm explaining specific
injustices of specific scenarios, and you're taking my messages as if
they were a complete statement of a logic problem.

I'm not trying to solve a logic problem.  I'm trying to avoid being
mistreated by computing, and identifying the kinds of mistreatment
that need to be avoided is part of the task.  It is hard enough to
define the boundaries of injustice even at the usual human level.
The sort of mathematical rigor you demand is not attainable here.

I am not concerned about it at all _on my own behalf_.  I don't want
or deserve control over your computation.

However, the browser-on-a-server would be doing _my_ browsing.  I am
not willing to entrust my browsing to a service controlled by some
stranger.  First of all, I would have no control over the browser or
what it does.  Also, I could not trust that service to respect my
privacy.

  >   But 
  > in that case you should be satisfied with the browserstack solution.   

If it surprises you that I object to something, that shows your
picture of my concerns is incomplete.  Naturally it is incomplete,
because I have been responding to specific questions about specific
scenarios.  I don't have a "complete" unified statement of what
can be unjust in computing, only descriptions of a number of
specific injustices.

You've "simplified" my statement of what's wrong with this so
radically that the crucial point is missing.  The crucial point is
that it executes the software _directly_ from a _specific_ server.

  > (d) But isn't that the case with almost -all- software?  Even

It is a lot like what happens with proprietary software.  But nothing
like that happens in my Trisquel GNU/Linux installation.

I decide which packages to install.  And I can install an alternate
version of any package.  I can alter the code of any package and use
that.  I am editing this message with a development version of GNU Emacs
rather than with the version packeged now in Trisquel.

Even if you never alter any package yourself, the fact that it is
controlled by a community in which you participate protects you to
some extent.  But when that extent isn't enough, you're welcome to
take more control into your own hands.

See fsf.org/tedx for a 14-minute video.  Early in the video
it explains the point about collective control.

  > Desktop software that updates itself

My system does not update itself!  I would not stand for that.
No upgrades are installed without my approval.

If you're talking about the development and posting of new package
versions, system does not "update itself" in that sense either.
Development is done by a community of people.

With the same level of abstraction, you could say that the difference
between Earth and a billiard ball is "just a matter of degree".  Now
try living on a billiard ball.

In theory, that is trivial.  In practice, giving users of that
Javascript code the same level of practical community control that we
currently enjoy in GNU/Linux is challenging.  I have suggested
approaches for doing this, but implementation of these (or others)
in a way that achieves the goal remains to be done.

  > What's the problem with "Free Javascript" for form validation?

Please forgive the long delay in my response.  I was overwhelmed by
other work, so I answered the easy questions and put off this question
which called for thought.

A nonfree program is an injustice, but the reason why free software
respects our freedom as much as effectively as it does is in the
system of its use.

Normally, a free program gets released, then people install it on
their computers to use it.  But you don't have to install it just the
way it was released.  You can modify the program, and use the modified
version when you prefer that.

Furthermore, others can release modified versions; then you can
install them and use them.  This is how the community has effective
control over what the program does.  Some of the effective freedom
that free software gives us comes about through this.

Even an ordinary user can select packages on Trisquel GNU/Linux (or
Debian) using apt-get, and with a little effort also install free
packages from source, because we publish easy ways to do this.

The practice of running a program straight out of a web page makes
those practices very difficult.  If the program is free (which
includes availability of its source code), they are not illegal or
impossible: free Javascript code is definitely better than non-free
Javascript code.  But you have to be a wizard to figure out how do
this.  An ordinary user like me -- and, for Javascript, ordinary user
is what I am -- has to learn too much before even trying.  To install
and use someone's modified version of site X's Javascript is much
harder, in practice, than installing and using someone's modified
version of Firefox.

Thus, under current conditions the community is not in a position to
draw the full benefit -- control by the users -- for Javascript code
run from web pages that we normally get from free software.

We may be able to fix that.  Perhaps some improvements in software and
community infrastructure could overcome this problem and arrange for
true community control over the Javascript programs.  Would anyone
like to work on this project?  It is an important project.

Until that is done, a site respects our freedom more thoroughly by
allowing us to run NO Javascript, than by solely putting a free
license on the source code of its Javascript code.

That may be true; if so, it demonstrates my point because I don't know
how to do any of that.  Those are not things users normally do.
They are not simple and easy like package installation with apt-get.

(ISTR being told by an expert, a few years ago, that Greasemonkey did
not reliably alter the JS in the page before it executes once.)

Is that a problem?  That depends on what job the server is doing.

I presume that I am entering information into an organization's web
site to ask the organization a question or request some work on my
behalf.  Once it gets the details of my request, it will do its job
and respond to me.  You expect me to see a problem in this, but it
appears to be a misunderstanding.  Whether I communicate the info by
phone, or through a web site, it;s equivalent as far as I see it.

On the other hand, if the job at hand is _my own computing_, I would
not entrust it to someone else's server.  For explanation, see
http://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html.  I
do that on my computer, with software I've put on my computer.

In principle, it makes no difference whether the program is in
Javascript, but the way I know how to install it is via apt-get
or via tar, configure, make.

To clarify:

If I want to do a computing task that could be done (even in theory)
in my own computer, then I refuse to let someone else's service get
involved.  (I can't have control over what someone else's service.)  I
will do it with a free program that's installed on my own computer.

I don't care what language it is written in, as long as free tools can
handle it.  What I object to about Javascript programs is not the
Javascript language itself, but the practice of running programs
straight off someone else's server.

Using something comparable to Greasemonkey is a painful way of trying
to get, with programs that come with web pages, what most languages
give us automatically.  If we don't make the mistake of running
programs straight off someone else's server, we don't have to correct
it.

In addition, the server operator could change the program from one day to
the next, and if we don't check for that, we will not notice.

    Google has been working with Qualcomm and HTC to open up the various
    blobs that were needed to build a working image, and as of Android
    2.2, you can build a complete working Nexus One firmware image from
    the public free software tree (for the first time in the history of
    Android).  I believe the same is true for the G1.  It took more than a
    year and a half but it's now possible.

That is exciting news -- can you possibly point me at details?

    Of course the baseband radio firmware is still not open (supposedly
    for regulatory reasons) and that's another story.

If that firmware comes preinstalled and users need not ever touch it,
it can be considered a circuit.

    I realize circuits can't easily be changed and chips can't easily be
    produced, but how is hardware exempted from the FSF principles of
    freedom? ?There are early-stage compilers that will produce hardware
    from a subset of C or C++ today, which blurs the line between software
    and hardware.

I don't see how a compiler alone could produce hardware, which is a
physical object.  So I suspect that you really mean the compilers
produce a hardware _design_.

In order for free hardware designs to make a difference for us, we
would need to be able to convert them into physical objects and use
them, as we now compile programs into object files and run them.  In
practice, we don't have the means to do so.

If and when we can obtain chip fabricators and make our own chips with
them, we will want to fabricate our chips only from free designs, and
these compilers might be useful in producing those.

    In the case of something that runs on a mobile phone or PDA, it's likely
    to be more accurate to call it a busybox/Linux distro.

If it has Busybox instead of GNU, then it isn't GNU/Linux.  A
busybox/Linux distro is very different from a GNU/Linux distro.  All
they have in common is Linux, and that's not much.

it made me wonder what that means.  Does it mean they snoop on 600
million Chinese people in each month?  I can't be sure, but it sounds
that way.

If that's what TalkingData does, should CSAIL legitimize that company
by affiliating with it?  Should CSAIL describe massive surveillance in
words that make it sound like a positive achievement?

It looks like this part of of China spies on its citizens and clamps
down on human rights.

I am making a surmise here, and I hope I am mistaken.  But that is
true, should CSAIL be the kind of organization that calls such
companies "allies"?

    HACKtheMACHINE Boston, is a weekend digital experience on board
    the USS Constitution and at MIT CSAIL that aims to engage a new
    generation of innovators and help support the U.S. Navy in its
    mission to maintain, train and equip combat ready naval
    forces. Participants will take on some of the greatest maritime
    security challenges of our time through real-life scenarios, from
    hacking a ship in a game of maritime capture the flag, using data
    science to increase fleet efficiency to applying AR/VR technology
    to create human to machine teaming tools that aid in disaster
    relief efforts.

Does anyone believe that the US Navy will use these contributions
only for disaster relief efforts?  Not for combat against enemy
armies and civilians?

Should CSAIL be doing military work?

Should CSAIL be doing military work
and describing it disingenuously
so as to make it appear uncontroversial?

I can think of some, but that's not the issue.  The issue is about
CSAIL's promoting military recruiting of developers and researchers
for military projects.

They chose to emphasize one project (perhaps real, perhaps notional)
that is aimed at helping civilians, but I suspect that is a
smokescreen.

  > :Should CSAIL be doing military work?

  > Would computers have been invented without Military funding?

You've changed the subject here too.
The issue is not about funding.
The issue is about working with the military on military projects.

Today I learned more about the event.  Someone from CSAIL HQ said that
it isn't a hackathon, but rather a PR activity.  The intention is to
impress students with favorable feelings toward the military, and
especially the military's powerful technology, so that they will be
eager to work on military projects of whatever kind.

Should CSAIL support that?

    My experience is that Dragon N-S is trained on a much larger
    corpus (mainly of dictations) than most other products.  Nuance
    has another business, which is manual transcription of dictations,
    and I suspect they use the results of that work to help train
    their speech models. It's difficult to find or generate a
    comparably large annotated data set to train from.

Developing a replacement for Unix was a big job, too.
However, our freedom is what's at stake, so even if the job
is big, we have to do it.

To trade your freedom for convenience is a bad deal.

    Its my understanding (or perhaps more accurately, my guess) that most broad
    surveillance programs work by identifying people who are communicating with
    known high risk individuals / organizations.

Actually, they don't.  NSA surveillance goes far beyond that.  William
Binney, a previous NSA whistleblower, says that the NSA ought to pull
back from massive surveillance and do just what you expect it to do.

http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2013/6/10/inside_the_nsas_domestic_surveillance_apparatus_whistleblower_william_binney_speaks_out

Senators report that massive surveillance goes far beyond what
recent leaks have disclosed.

http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/06/13-0

Senators in the Intelligence Committee say they don't believe massive
surveillance has stopped or caught any terrorists.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/13/senators-challenge-nsa-surveillance-terrorism

However, even if it had done so, that would not justify massive
surveillance.  The danger of a government that can keep wrongdoing
secret from us, by intimidating whistleblowers, is enormous, and the
danger of terrorists (other than the US government) is pretty small
compared with many others.  (Terrorists killed fewer Americans than
car accidents even in September 2001.)  We must keep our attention on
the big danger.

Laws are a means that we set up to try to achieve justice.
We should take care not to elevate the means above the end.

These laws have been set up to ensure courts cannot review them.
http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/11/edward-snowden-security-state

Whether the PAT RIOT Act, carefully interpreted, permits this massive
surveillance is a question relevant to diagnosing the cause of the
problem.  It is not relevant to the conclusion that there is a problem.

Whether the PAT RIOT Act is constitutional depends on whether one
interprets the constitution in favor of executive power or human rights.

    What's surprising to me is that people appear surprised by the

    privacy and civil liberties have had pretty good guesses as to methods 
    and capabilities for decades, and there were occasional confirmations in

Before now, we could presume that the US government was massively
spying on all of us.  I've said in speeches and interviews that I
expect the US government, given its known tendencies, to use the PAT
RIOT Act this way.  But we did not have proof, and that made our
suspicions easy to dismiss.

Analyzing Snowden's revelations as a conflict of asymmetric courage.

https://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/06/13-6

One detail in the article superficially appears to be an error.  It
says that the US security state has no law.  In fact, it does have law
at its disposal.  It has plenty of laws, designed to allow it to spy,
imprison and even kill effectively without limit, and cut off all
roads for us to find out what it is doing (except with the help of
leakers such as Snowden), let alone control it.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/11/edward-snowden-security-state

  However, this amounts to a declaration of lawlessness, so that
detail is correct when not interpreted with rigid literalism.

Massive surveillance leads to a government that is out of control
because it means that whistleblowers can be caught and punished.

It's not enough to probe their statements for logical holes.  To see
if they are valid requires investigating other information about those
cases.  We have already seen two such claims which proved to be
invalid once the other facts were known.

However, even if they come up with irrefutable proof that massive
surveillance prevented attacks that might have killed some Americans,
that would still be insufficient justification.  Such attacks are far
less than the danger of a government that is out of control.

And that's not even to mention that US attacks that kill innocent
people are among the main inspiration for most of the attempted or
real terrorism against the US in the past decade.  There's no need to
spy on everyone, since stopping the aerial death squad would do the
job.

    The way to reduce hatred and fear is through community. Obviously
    unmanned drones that kill people don't help to foster community, but it
    takes much more than stopping active murder to make a friend.

The US should do a lot more than just ceasing to kill unarmed people.
However, a mere lack of friendship won't make people hate Americans
and want to kill us.  I therefore suggest that a much smaller change
-- to stop killing civilians -- would probably suffice to stop
inspiring terrorism against the US.

    * If you use unusual encryption, you might be drawing attention to 
    yourself, defeating your purpose.

Using GnuPG is not very unusual.  Lots of people do it.
I have never heard any report that someone was mistreated for this;
I think  you are making a mountain out of a nonexistent molehill.

      You want for lots and lots of people 
    to be using encryption, so that your own use doesn't flag you as having 
    something to hide or generally being a troublemaker,

If you want this (or anything) to become more common, start doing it.
Then it will be a little more common.

    * Don't trust your encryption very much.

Encryption is sufficient to keep the encrypted data out of the sort of
dossier that is made about everyone as a matter of routine.

If there is a specific reason to investigate you, there are all sorts
of ways the thugs could observe you.  They could even insert a camera
into your home and watch your screen.

But they would not get to see your screen _in the past_ that way.

    Only a tiny percentage of email uses GnuPG, so it's unusual.  I can only 
    speculate here, but, if you were the NSA, wouldn't you have a setup that 
    automatically detects use of encryption in email, adds that fact to 
    profiles (for later querying and statistical analysis), and then uses 
    that information to increase some of the interesting-ness score for 
    those profiles and emails?

It would be irrational and foolish for them to try to find terrorists
by looking for GnuPG users.

They are capable of irrationality and folly, but you shouldn't assume
that they do something merely on the grounds it would be irrational
and foolish.

    > Encryption is sufficient to keep the encrypted data out of the sort of
    > dossier that is made about everyone as a matter of routine.
    >    

    I would not guess that this is true, perhaps unless and until use of 
    email encryption becomes commonplace.

It is not a matter of guessing.  We know this.  Snowden said that the
NSA can't break our strong encryption.

It follows that encrypting something is enough to keep it out
of the sort of dossier that they make about most everyone.

If there were a specific reason to really investigate you,
there are all sorts of ways to do that.  But I'm not talking about
how to keep a very sensitive secret.  I'm talking about how to keep
ordinary life out of your dossier.

That you can imagine how the NSA might invade millions of people's
computers does not prove it does so.

The state certainly can get access to the inside of someone's
computer, with a warrant.  It can install a key-logger, with a warrant.
But this is not the usual dossier-making that it does to
everyone for no particular reason.  There is no evidence that
the state does this to people in general, or even to encryption-users
in general.

People should use a wide range of methods to resist massive
surveillance.  People should also organize to prevent massive
surveillance.  I do both, and you should too.

A few days ago the topic arose of whether using encryption would subject
people to intense investigation.

According to recent revelations about how much the NSA can record the
calls and emails of Americans, we see that using encryption does
make a difference: they will save such messages permanently if they
"happen" to get a copy.  See
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/use-of-tor-and-e-mail-crypto-could-increase-chances-that-nsa-keeps-your-data/.

If you are using encryption because you're discussing committing a
crime, and you never want it to come out, that might be of concern to
you.  As for those of us that use encryption on general principles to
reduce massive surveillance, I don't think we should let this deter
us.

    Tanker trucks carrying tens of thousands of gallons of flammable
    liquid *already* frequent our streets. The question is, if you are so
    strongly opposed to a train carrying ethanol, why are you not equally
    strongly opposed to the trucks that supply our gas stations? It would
    seem that these trucks are a much greater hazard.

Perhaps we should ALSO be concerned about those trucks.
But they have nothing to do with the question at hand:
whether to shift the ethanol from barges to trains.

Your argument seems to take the form, "Don't bother to prevent problem
A, because problem B is bigger."  (Problem A is the danger from ethanol
trains, and problem B is the danger from gasoline trucks.)

I don't know whether B is really bigger than A, but it's irrelevant
because the two problems are independent.  They have a similarity, but
they are not linked in practice.  Having problems A and B at once
would be worse than just having problem B.

Under what circumstances would the existence of problem B be a reason
not to address problem A?

* If the solution for problem A would make B worse.

* If preventing problem A would make it harder to address B.

Neither of those is the case.  On the contrary, activism about problem
A will tend to increase the possibiloty of action about problem B.

Both A and B are a part of the broad and large problem of using lots
of fossil fuel.  (Ethanol in fuel was conceived as a partial solution
but it does more harm than good.)  Activism about A will help increase
general activism to prevent global heating, which is another side
benefit that may eventually extend to eliminating problem B.

Thus, problem B is relevant -- but not in the way some are arguing.

This invention sounds very dangerous.  Think of the Xbox One,
designed to be able to determine how many people are in the room
and whether they are looking at it.  Microsoft backed down
on some of the increased DRM of the Xbox One, but I don't think
they backed down on this.

      Should we be capricious when it comes to the
    mitigation of this risk, deciding that one fuel is more of an issue
    than the other?

It is no caprice.  There is a proposal to change how the ethanol
is transported, and others started a campaign to block the change.
As regards gasoline transport, no change is proposed and there
is no campaign.

So you're trying to distract attention from a present issue
to one that is not on the table.  It's a red herring.

    I only mention other fuels for perspective, not distraction.

When issue A is already publicly raised and issue B is not, to judge
them by the same standard would be false perspective.

    If the train traveled to Boston, it would not need to pass through
    Providence.

That could be a relevant point.  I don't think that people in
Cambridge are more important than people in Providence.  However, they
aren't less important either.  I think we should still campaign
against this as a way to oppose the harmful policy of making ethanol
from corn.

    It'll be interesting to gather a poll on how many people cared about this
    and how many didn't, and track also their background. I have this huge
    hunch that this is such a first world problem that only people with
    privileged up-bringing would care about.

This is an ad-hominem attack.  Even if your claim is are right, it is
irrelevant to the issue.

In general, concern for the environment comes with a certain level of
prosperity.  It started in the US and Europe.  Now people in China are
starting to care about the environment in China.  Good for them!
Everyone in the world ought to be "privileged" enough to care about
the environment.  But even though they aren't, that doesn't make
the environment unimportant.

    In order to print to these new copiers you will be required to download 
    a new printer driver, which can be done at this location: 
    http://tig.csail.mit.edu/twiki/bin/view/TIG/ListOfPublicPrintersAndTheirDrivers 

Is there a free driver for GNU/Linux?




    Tomorrow, a trainer from Xerox will be here for the first in a series of 
    training sessions here at CSAIL to bring us up to speed on the 
    capabilities of the 7655.

I suggest asking them how to turn off the surveillance feature of
printing dots that express the printer's ID.  Of course, they will not
provide any way to do this; but it is important that they be
confronted frequently with push-back for their surveillance.  If they
get push-back all the time, strong enough to make them want to quit
their jobs, it might start to do some good.






    The Infrastructure Group (tig) is evaluating the cost-efficiency of  
    providing bulk licensing for several Adobe products, namely Photoshop  
    and Illustrator.

There's a version of the GIMP that mimics the interface of Photoshop.
I've heard that Photoshop users generally are happy with that.
How about seeing if the lab's users who might have wanted Photoshop
are happy with that, before promoting a proprietary program?




If you want to trade, come to 32-381 during any of that time.




    * I am aware of and a user of GNU/Linux and all the great alternatives it 
    provides to society.

Calling GNU/Linux is an "alternative" to Windows
is like calling democracy an "alternative" to dictatorship.
It's not wrong, but it's a drastic understatement.

I hope you can soon arrange to defenestrate the other machine.




    Researchers at CSAIL and Nokia Research Center Cambridge are jointly
    developing a new prototype application to help you organize the
    thoughts, notes, and information you work with every day.

Before we help you develop it, there is an important question to be
asked.  Will you release this application as free software?




When they distribute  source code, is it under a free license?
Is it published?

(If it is secret, looking at it can get you in trouble later.)

      If
    your floor evacuation signal sounds after this message, walk to the
    nearest stairway and leave the floor.

Every time I hear that, I wonder what the floor evacuation signal for
my floor would sound like.  I can never be sure I have NOT heard it.

    How about if they (MIT) provides written explanation, both in
    email (maybe even paper!) and on the walls near the emergency exit
    doors.

This would have been a useful thing to do; however, if I understand
the other messages right, our building has changed to a simpler
system, so I think this sort of explanation is not needed any more.

The failure to address the issue of the license for scientific
publication is a natural consequence of using the term "open access",
which directs attention to being able to get a copy, rather than
towards freedom in using it.

See http://stallman.org/free-scientific-publication.html.

I think this flaw is a bigger problem than the 12-month waiting period,
because that delay is temporary, but a bad license is forever.

If we set up a server for distributing research results,
I suggest that we establish clear and firm license criteria
for all kinds of materials posted there.  For articles, we should
follow the arxiv by using CC-BY.

Let's also establish that access should not require running any
nonfree software, including nonfree Javascript software.

      One major improvement is that, at least for faculty, we now have
    a policy in place, described at
    http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/scholarly/mit-open-access/open-access-at-mit/mit-amendment-form/
    that encourages (or perhaps requires to try) that faculty get an
    agreement from a publisher to permit making a version of their
    papers freely available: "MIT may make the Article available, and
    may exercise any and all rights under copyright relating thereto,
    in any medium, provided that the Article is not sold for a profit,
    and may authorize others to do the same."

This policy would be great, if only MIT applied it firmly.
However, with the easy exceptions, it may not achieve the goal.

The idea of an "Internet of things" makes me very worried.
I don't want MY things to talk to the Internet.  If they did,
I am sure companies and governments I don't trust would get information
through them about everything I do.

If I get Internet-equipped "things" I will break their antennas.

I suggest asking whoever sent you that powerpoint file
not to send data in Microsoft proprietary formats.
See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html
(it's about Word format, but the same issue applies
to powerpoint format).




There is free software for symbolic algebra--for exaple, there is
Maxima, a free development of Macsyma, which was developed here.
If freedom counts for something, a decision like this shouldn't
be made purely on technical grounds.




    There's an unstated requirement here: that 'visitors' not ever be exposed 
    to the 'ugly' (freight) elevator.

This is utter stupidity.  Does someone think that sponsors
don't know buildings have freight elevators?




If normally not using the freight elevator saves energy, I wouldn't
mind waiting a little longer for that purpose.  If, however, it is a
matter of incompetence or foolishness, that's another story.




    :Don't I recall that the 545 Tech Square elevators placed all four
    :elevators in a single service group with extra buttons to call the
    :freight elevator?

I had the same experience.  Except on rare cases when I specifically
wanted the freight elevator, I pushed only the main button, but
sometimes the freight elevator was the one that came.




    The other reference that triggered a reaction was to MatLab, which
    despite its many wonderful advantages, insulates students from
    the details such as computational complexity and prevents them
    from being forced to learn serious programming skills.

Another kind of social problem with MatLab is that it is proprietary
software.  If you want to insulate yourself from computational
complexity, and/or make pretty graphs, please use Octave.
At least then you won't have to give up your freedom as well.





If there is no free software now to do this job, how about developing
some?  Most of the existing free programs got developed when someone
decided to write it rather than wish someone else would.




I am obliged to remind people that Matlab is a proprietary program.
It doesn't respect the freedom of those who use it.

There is a free replacement named Octave which does the same job.
It does not have the same range of high-level packages, so your
help is needed in extending them.





Would someone like to attend this and bring Bad Vista stickers
or Windows 7 Sins stickers to give out to other attendees?
The FSF would be glad to give you some.
